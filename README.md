## Machine Learning team is responsible to :
* Collect data and cleansing the data
* Architecting model and use the best model to get the best accuracy
* Model to get the best accuracy

The model is created using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and got 78% validation accuracy.
Our neural network algorithm uses an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture consisting of two Dense layers.
This algorithm uses the ReLU activation function in the hidden layer and the sigmoid activation function in the output layer
