Israeli artist Alex Levin has been banned by Google for his Jewish and Jerusalem paintings Alex Levin Jun 22·2 min read

A few years ago, a scandal erupted on Facebook about the closure of the artist Alex Levin’s page. Alex Levin is an Israeli artist, whose paintings are exhibited in many galleries around the world, in museums, in the Israeli Knesset, in many private collections in Israel, the USA, Canada, Russia and other countries of the world. One of the main themes of the artist is Jewish life (Judaica), as well as Jerusalem and the streets of Tel Aviv. The page was reopened, and Zuckerberg had to personally apologize to the artist.

Waves of anti-Semitism have reached Google, which was developed and founded by Jews (by the way). Of the 400 Jerusalem paintings by Alex Levin put up for sale through Google Shopping, 61 paintings were suddenly banned with completely inadequate definitions like religious beliefs and nudity and with inaccessible resources for appeal. See screenshots below. Considering the recent statement by the Jews of Google employees about supporting the Palestinians against Israel, this action cannot be viewed otherwise than as a manifestation of anti-Semitism.

- “There are only 61 Jewish paintings out of four hundred,” somebody would argue.

Well yes! It all starts small. And we know how it ends…
