My faith in You has carried me through.

Or was it my faith in me?

Have faith, have faith, be patient and have faith,

you’ll get there, you’ll see, you’ll manage, have faith.

Is it faith though that carried me through?

Maybe it was hope and the idea of me and You.

I have faith in the universe where I feel I was thrown

as a wingless butterfly at birth.

The power of my being exceeds the capacity of comprehension I’ve managed to acquire and so I seek strength through my convictions.

I go back to the fountain of my being trying to grasp more meaning. How do we come? Where do we dissolve? Do we dissipate or just reassemble, tiny particles flying together taking one shape or another?

I’m gazing at the shape I’m crowding the universe with these days and I’m determined to embrace it as all there is. For now.

Yes, I do believe I have faith.
