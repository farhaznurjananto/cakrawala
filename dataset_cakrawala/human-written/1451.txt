Investigators say a man set a Penn Hills house on fire after an argument with the home's residents.

According to a criminal complaint, Venson does not live in the house, but the couple that lives there had allowed him to sleep in the home from time to time because he had been homeless. Last week, Venson allegedly started behaving strangely, including walking into the couple's bedroom multiple times on Wednesday before finally being told to leave.

On Thursday night, the couple told police they were upstairs in their bedroom when the smelled something cooking. They say Venson and a friend had let themselves into the house unannounced and cooked all of their sausage.

Investigators say the residents became angry and told Venson to leave, but he refused. After 10 minutes of arguing, the residents called police. Venson then agreed to go, but first went into the basement.

Police say Venson came back upstairs when officers arrived. They took his information and allowed him to go, but soon noticed smoke was pouring out of the duplex. The female resident was overcome by the smoke, and had to be dragged out by police.

Arson investigators determined the fire was set intentionally in the basement, and that Venson was likely responsible. Police worked with Venson's family, and he surrendered at the Penn Hills Police Department on Saturday. His bail was set at $1,000 and he faces a preliminary hearing on Jan. 27.
