Madhu Chamarty, our mentor for the sixth session of Edudot, taught us about MVP or Minimum Viable Product. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

As you can see that in the top row, the product is only usable at its final stage, but in the bottom row, each stage of the product is usable in some way and that’s what we call MVP.

After that Madhu told about the Golden Circle Model : Simon Sinek’s theory of value proposition.

An MVP is the simplest idea to represent your product. Learn from your mistakes. Keep improving your product. Don’t get disappointed by your failures. They will help understand your flaws and will take the product one step closer to success.
