Alaska Railroad is celebrating the National Park Service’s centennial with a new, eight-day tour this summer of four of Alaska’s most spectacular parks.

Alaska’s National Parks by Rail trains will visit Gates of the Artic National Park and Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, Lake Clark National Park and Preserve and Kenai Fjords National Park. The tour involves travel along the entire length of the railroad’s main line.

Excursions along the way include flightseeing over the Arctic Circle, cruising Alaska’s coastal waters, fly-in bear viewing and a full day of wildlife viewing in Denali National Park and Preserve.

Alaska’s National Parks by Rail runs from June 2 to Aug. 25. Prices start at $3,140 per person.

In addition, from Feb. 23 through the end of March, the Alaska Railroad is expanding its Aurora Winter Train service between Anchorage and Fairbanks. Trains will travel north from Anchorage to Fairbanks on Tuesday and travel south from Fairbanks to Anchorage on Wednesday. Service also is available weekends.

By expanding midweek service to Fairbanks, visitors and locals alike will better be able to enjoy events such as the BP World Ice Art Championships or take a trip to the Chena Hot Springs Resort for a soak under the Northern Lights.
