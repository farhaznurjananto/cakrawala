Great souls appear to be missing today

No inspiring leaders for just human causes

None with the stature of Mahatma Gandhi

Or unshakeable moral character like MLK

Political integrity of RFK or John McCain.

Our world could use some great souls now

To set an example of what’s right and just

Inspiring human causes for our greater good

Initiating new golden era of human rights

Breaking centuries racist barriers lingering.

Until some great soul appears on the scene

We should look to our own inner consciences

To understand what contributions, we can make

In creating equal opportunities for everyone

Helping freedom’s bell to ring loud and true.

Human rights, society’s perpetual challenge

Destroying prejudices so long in existence

Making progress towards equal justice for all,

Looking deeply into our own great souls.
