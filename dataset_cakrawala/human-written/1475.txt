In general, watching Netflix is not haram.

The/a specific content could/can be haram. There are tons of content on Netflix. There are haram contents available and also halal contents available. It depends on you which you pick, halal or haram. You should avoid watching haram contents and you are allowed to watch halal contents.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

“Verily, the lawful (Halal) is clear and the unlawful (Haram) is clear.”-(Sahih Bukhari 52, Sahih Muslim 1599).

The Quran said:

‘Say, “My Lord has only forbidden immoralities — what is apparent of them and what is concealed — and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and what you say about Allah that which you do not know.”-(Quran 7:33).

Halal is an Arabic word. Halal is something which is lawful or permissible according to Islam. Haram is also an Arabic word. Haram is something which is unlawful or impermissible according to Islam.

A person should do/have etc which is halal and he/she should avoid/ignore everything that is haram. Many people believe that Islam made haram most of the things of the world, which is totally wrong concept. Everything in/of the world is halal. Yes, I am repeating again, everything in/of the world is halal. Only a hand-counted few things are haram that are/is immoral or harmful to/for us.

Note: I am not promoting Netflix, nor any product of Netflix.
