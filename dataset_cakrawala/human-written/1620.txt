Ed McCaffrey’s oldest son has gone to the Dark Side.

Duke receiver Max McCaffrey was among nine prospects that attended the Broncos’ local pro day before the draft. Given that his father won two Super Bowls with Denver, many fans were excited about the prospect about the younger No. 87 landing with the Broncos.

But that won’t happen, the receiver’s agent told Mike Klis of KUSA-TV.

Broncos general manager John Elway wanted McCaffrey.

Instead, McCaffrey chose to sign with one of Denver’s division rivals, the Raiders, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.

Broncos fans can take solace in knowing that Christian McCaffrey, Max’s younger brother that was a Heisman Trophy candidate last season with Stanford, remains an option for Denver going forward.

Christian, a running back who may consider transitioning to slot receiver in the pros, may enter the NFL draft in 2017. Last season, he broke the NCAA’s single-season record with 3,864 all-purpose yards.
