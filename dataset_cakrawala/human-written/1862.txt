Hello! 👋🏻 In this article, we will tell you about blockchain tokenization and Barter’s unique offer.

💳 Tokenization is the process of converting the value of an asset into a digital token. This simplifies interaction with them, and trading operations are carried out much faster and more convenient for all parties.

❓ Why has tokenization acquired such mass character only recently?

🔗 With the advent of blockchain, the real potential of tokenization has opened up as it has become even faster and more secure. Almost any information can be recorded in the blockchain.

📌 At the same time, fundraising using tokens is cheaper than the usual fundraising. This is also one of the advantages of blockchain as it does not require significant funds for intermediaries.

📌 By conducting an ICO, startups can easily comply with all regulations, as if they were conducting regular fundraising through the sale of company shares. Investors can easily increase the liquidity of assets if they invest enough funds.

❓ What is unique about the Barter team?

📌 Barter is a blockchain trading platform providing tokenization services for various asset classes.

📌 Using modern Ethereum standards on our platform, you can easily tokenize any assets. For example, movable or immovable property, luxury items or collectibles for subsequent sale for liquid tokens or the usual fiat currency.

📌 With the help of smart contracts, which act as a guarantor of the transaction, both parties are confident in fulfilling each other’s obligations and confidentiality.

💡 Contract value can be discounted up to 100% for customers who tokenized real valuable assets using the Barter service

✔️ Thus, thanks to the Barter ecosystem, you can easily tokenize any valuable asset and later conveniently sell it without intermediaries, where smart contracts act as a guarantor.
