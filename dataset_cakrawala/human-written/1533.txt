Hello,

I have an optimization problem to solve with non-linear constraints. It is a control theory based discrete time model (which i feel fules out using fmincon) over a time horizon say N seconds.

I found a few old posts similar to this, but none I felt had clear answers.

I am going nuts trying to find a way to implement it in matlab. Which Matlab tool would be best suited in this case?

Thanks,

italic EDIT: the system is continuous, but we analyse it in a discrete time domain. Thus, variables have discrete values. There are n_v entities and each of the entity has each parameter described below:

variables: p,v,u; size(p)=size(v)=size(u)=(1,N) vectors

Obj. fn: minimize sum(u(1,:))
