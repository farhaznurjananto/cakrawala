Bits

I feel like a ghost

in this world

and it feels good.

No body, no time,

just bits

flying back and forth.

Lighter than the angels.

Just figures of speech

encoded in bits

flying who knows where.

We are

all bits of information

completely out

of our corporeal

minds.

Existing as

digital ghosts, like the stars.

We see across time.

Starlight from bodies burned out

long ago

blown to bits,

into photons of light,

lighter than the angels.

A culture of bits of information

flying back and forth.

Flying in circles,

circling back

in a world

smitten to bits.

Just a figure of light,

and it feels so good

to be this free -

but I miss

my life.
