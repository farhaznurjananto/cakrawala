What’s Replacing Emails?

With the slow death of the email newsletter, what will take its place in the marketing world? Firstly, if 20% of recipients are still opening emails, and you’re using the content generated for other parts of your strategy, emails still have a place in marketing. It’s not difficult to generate good looking emails linking to interesting content for those who are still consuming information that way.

But to avoid blowing your marketing budget, anything used in an email needs to be used somewhere else too. In fact, your marketing messages need to appear in many places and be seen a number of times before they have an impact.

Some people see text messaging as the next big thing, but I feel that will be short-lived. I already ignore text messages that are sent from businesses, and I can’t remember the last time I actually clicked a link in a marketing text to see what they were actually offering. I could be wrong, and there could be a golden time for text-message-marketing, but I don’t think it’ll be the gold star tactic.

Social media seems like it’s here to stay, so it’s a good idea to share your message where people already have their attention. That means breaking it down into thumb-stopping posts and building on your profile and reputation.

Businesses who are relying on emails will continue to struggle to stand out, but combining showing up in inboxes with appearing on social media, and even in targeted display ads, they might have an impact.

Sending emails is easy, and everyone is doing it — which is why they’ve lost their value. Clever marketers are taking a broader approach to marketing, and more importantly, remaining agile and awake to the changes in customer behaviour and attention.
