3 Reasons Why You Should Be More Like Bamboo

What looks weak is strong.

Have you ever wondered how sharks keep their teeth so white without going to the dentist? Well, even if you haven’t, I bet that’s all you’re thinking about now.

It turns out actually, that sharks do indeed go to a dentist, just not the same kind as you or I. Most notably in the coral reefs of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, “cleaner fish” showcase themselves with their bright colors and set up underwater cleaning stations. Sharks let them know it’s safe to approach, and the cleaner fish then eat the mucus, bacteria, and fungus off the sharks’ pearly whites.

The relationship is mutually beneficial. The cleaner fish get a meal, and the sharks get a mouth free from danger. This is known as symbiosis.

Symbiosis is the art of living and working together to create an advantageous relationship. Parents help children grow up and children (hopefully) help parents when they grow old. Bees gather nectar from flowers and help pollinate more flowers in the process. I believe that writers should have symbiotic relationships as well.

This is why when chatting with Akshad Singi, I knew it was an opportunity to both teach and learn. By working together instead of competing against one another with our writing, I believe we can share a message that can benefit more people. Thus, we have decided to join forces to provide two articles that promote the same concept: why we should be more like bamboo.

When discussing bamboo, I couldn’t help but consider whether or not the relationship between pandas and bamboo is symbiotic as well. Sure, the pandas eat the bamboo, but the bamboo get to feed an endangered species. Bamboo also gets the opportunity to be further studied and assessed for its tremendously unique qualities, as I will discuss in the remainder of the piece. While reading, consider your symbiotic relationships and wonder how and why you can be more like bamboo.
