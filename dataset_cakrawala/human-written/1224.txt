Watching the Girls Go Bi

And bye bye as well with this lady!

I’ve often wondered what exactly it is about female escorts that makes an inordinate percentage of them bisexual. Are they super horny and just want to get down with everybody? Or is it all the competition they encounter working at houses that makes them resolve the conflict by simply coupling up with another girl who has one particular asset she herself wishes were hers?

Whatever…whether a large percentage of escorts are bisexual is virtually beyond debate. After almost 18 years of dealing with the girls, I can say unequivocally that a) I’ve met a statistically significant sampling and b)…that many do have sex with women as well as men.

Years ago, I was fooling around with a girl who told me in no uncertain terms that she liked women as well as men. In fact, what she really said was she seeks men out for relationships…and women for love! It’s women she falls in love with!

Maybe 10 days ago during a phone conversation, the girl informed me that she had to cut off the call as she was being rude to her new “roommate” who had just moved in. The roommate is a girl she once worked with in Brooklyn. I got the idea that maybe there was more to this deal than roommateship. And sure enough, that was the last time I spoke with her. I can guess what happened.

I told this little anecdote to one of her colleagues and the girl responded with some confusion “you were going out with so-and-so? You know she’s gay, right?” I feel complimented that at least for a hot minute, this girl had swung to the other side with me. But alas, her true colors came shining through. What are ya gonna do?

I relate this today because recently I met somebody’s “husband,” who intellectualized the difference between having semen versus “pussy juice” on her face and in her mouth. For her, PJ was preferable. I did not inquire as to her sexual orientation. I didn’t need to!
