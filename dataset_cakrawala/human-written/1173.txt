Danny had entered puberty. He had a cassette player that his dad gave him when he got back from Korea. It was battery-operated. Danny took it with him to the “outpost,” a place out in the forest where he went to be alone and listen to music.

There was so much great music coming out at the time. Danny had an hour-long cassette of all of his favorite songs. He listened to it all day and his favorite place to listen to it was the outpost. He would sit on his favorite boulder and put the headphones on. He would look up at the tree tops and be swept away to different worlds.

One of Danny’s favorite songs was a number one hit song by the Bee Gees called, How Can You Mend a Broken Heart? It was a beautiful song he listened to as he imagined a future love life.

Danny had never had a girlfriend. He had no idea yet what a broken heart felt like. Listening to that song, he figured it must be a very, very intense feeling. And it must be beautiful somehow.

“I hope to someday experience that,” he thought to himself.

…and so it eventually came to pass.
