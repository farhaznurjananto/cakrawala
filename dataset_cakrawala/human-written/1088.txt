In a clip published by CNN’s K-File on Saturday, Stern and the GOP presidential nominee are discussing the businessman’s children when Stern chimes in.

“My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,” Trump says.

“By the way your daughter,” Stern interrupts. “Can I say this? A piece of ass.”

“Yeah,” Trump responds.

In another clip from 2006, Stern asked Trump whether his daughter had recently gotten breast implants because “she’s looking more voluptuous than ever.”

“She is some catch,” Stern said.

"She's actually always been very voluptuous," Trump responds. "She's tall, she's almost 6 feet tall and she's been, she's an amazing beauty.

“She’s got a lot of things going. More importantly than anything, she is beautiful but she’s very smart."

The new report emerges as Trump faces fallout from leaked tapes released Friday by the Washington Post showing Trump making vulgar comments about groping women.

Dozens of Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump since the report came out, with many rescinding their endorsements or calling on Trump to leave the GOP presidential ticket.
