You win the Indianapolis 500 or the Monaco Grand Prix; if you’re lucky, you survive the 24 Hours of Le Mans. That thought was the premise behind Audi’s 2009 documentary, entitled Truth in 24, which is still available as a free download on iTunes.
The film captured the story of Audi’s preparation for the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans, including races at Sebring and Monza. The rivalry between Audi and Peugeot is central to the story, and by the Le Mans race, Audi is clearly the underdog. If you haven’t seen it, we won’t spoil the ending, but we’ll tell you this: if you're a racing fan, it’s worth the download.
In two weeks, Audi will present its follow-up video, entitled Truth in 24 II. The new film tells the story of Audi’s efforts at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans, where only one of three entries survived until the end of the race. Once again, it comes down to a battle between Audi and Peugeot, but this time victory is decided by a margin of just 13 seconds.
Like the original, the sequel is produced by Intersport and NFL Films, who know a thing or two about capturing action footage. Jason Statham is back as narrator, too, which should give the follow-up the same gritty, you-are-there feel as the original.
You can view the trailers for both the original video and the upcoming sequel on the Truth in 24 website, where you can even schedule a reminder when the new video is available for download. If you’re a fan of endurance racing or a fan of Audi, you’ll want to add both videos to your collection.
