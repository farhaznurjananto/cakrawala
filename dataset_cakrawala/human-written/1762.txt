E3 2019 Predictions with Daryl Baxter

Super Jump gears up for the big event

Can you believe we’re already on the eve of another E3? All indications suggest that this year’s show will be another huge one. In this very special episode of the Super Jump Podcast, Mitchell Wolfe and friend-of-the-show Daryl Baxter put their heads together to come up with predictions for each major E3 exhibitor. Discussing our hopes, dreams, and fears is always a lot of fun ahead of an E3. Also, Mitchell accidentally calls Daryl “Dylan”! Multiple times! It’s truly embarrassing!

All this and more on this week’s episode of the Super Jump Podcast!
