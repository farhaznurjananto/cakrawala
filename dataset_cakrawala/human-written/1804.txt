Rachel’s motif is the looking glass theory, how one views themselves based on the characteristics external factors assign. This motif is arguably the most transparent; the protagonist is repeatedly viewing himself in the mirror (literally viewing how others see him), basks in the affirmation from his plug, and even uses his book draft as an experiment to authentically witness how cis non-cross dressers view him. There is a strange juxtaposition where he seems both comfortable and unsure of his identity. At home, with the help of the soundtrack, he lounges comfortably. His home is his own private sanctuary where he can be himself. However, when it comes to articulating his experience, he can never completely articulate it. There is this underlying anxiety- his lack of concentration towards his book and the use of weed as an escape are obvious signs. It is almost as if the protagonist isn’t pushing to decide what he is, let alone articulate it. The repeated cozy elements of the home (lounging on the couch, ambiance music, wine, and –one you simply can’t forget-weed) let us know that this is his safe space. He isn’t looking to find himself, he just wants to BE.
