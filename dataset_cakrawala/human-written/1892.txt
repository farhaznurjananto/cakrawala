LOS ANGELES, CA A Los Angeles Police Department officer was seriously injured when he was struck while outside of his patrol car by a suspected DUI driver in one of two crashes that left both sides of the San Diego (405) Freeway in the Sawtelle area shut down for a time Tuesday.

The crash involving the officer occurred at 11:47 p.m. Monday on the northbound freeway near Santa Monica Boulevard, said California Highway Patrol Officer Tony Polizzi.

The officer, who had just pulled over a speeding vehicle, was out of his car when a vehicle struck him, according to reports from the scene. The officer was rushed to a hospital with serious injuries but was expected to survive.

The driver who struck the officer was arrested, Polizzi said.

All northbound lanes were closed until about 6 a.m., when two lanes were reopened, the CHP reported. By about 7:30 a.m., all but one northbound lane had been reopened.

At 4:07 a.m., a separate crash shut down the southbound lanes of the 405 on the other side of where that initial crash occurred, according to Polizzi. It wasn't immediately clear if anyone was injured in that crash.

All southbound lanes were open about 5 a.m.
