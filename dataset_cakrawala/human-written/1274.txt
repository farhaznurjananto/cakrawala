The tale of the girl between the two doors

(See below article*)

“Between the two doors,” she’d said to my grandmother. And for days, the words echoed in her mind as she tried to make sense of it. What’s between the two doors? Which two doors? But no answer came; all was quiet for days. And then it came to her. The attic. The attic was the only place in the house where there was a space between two doors — the door at the bottom of the stairs, and the heavy trap door we had to push up to get into the airless space.

Armed with a flashlight and determination, she trekked up to the second floor once the children were off to school. It was an old house, full of cracks and nooks and crannies. She searched for nearly an hour and was about to give up when she heard the voice in her mind once more. “Between the two doors.” In desperation, she cried out loud, “There’s nothing between the two doors!”. This time an answer came. One word. “Look.”

She sighed and sat on one of the worn wooden steps, and then she saw the gap — how had she not seen it before? There was a gap, wide enough to slide her slender arm in. With the beam of the flashlight, she illuminated the web and dust-filled space until the beam landed on a square piece of yellowed paper. She could barely reach, but with the tips of her fingers, she managed to grab the edge and pull it up.

Her breath caught in her throat as she turned it over and saw it was an old photograph.

A small black and white print of a young girl of about three or four, with white-blond ringlets, sitting with her arms around what appeared to be her baby brother — a little boy of about one, in shorts and suspenders. What broke my grandmother’s heart was that the corner of the picture was torn, removing the baby’s head. Her breath caught as she swallowed the tears, and the words were barely a whisper. “This is you.” There was no answer, but she knew it to be the truth.
