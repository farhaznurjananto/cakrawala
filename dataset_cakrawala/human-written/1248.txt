It would be unsophisticated to use

the words, night, flight, and might

in a flimsy, cheesy poem.

Readers with standards,

who hold dear the value of a deeper meaning,

will soon forget your mindless ploy.

To create a meager word toy.

But you remember, and you can never forget

the burning embers, of that night

when two pounding hearts, took flight

and held each other, with all their might.
