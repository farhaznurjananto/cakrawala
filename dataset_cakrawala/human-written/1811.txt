This is how we can look at Tugu Yoygakarta that is well-known as international tourism site.

Burası Yogyakarta. Yogyakarta büyük ve kalabalık bir şehir. Bunlar ağaçlar. Ağaçlar yeşil. Bunlar dağ. Bunlar Merapi dağ ve Tidar dağ. Bunlar ev. Evler büyük ve küçük. Evler mavi ve beyaz. Çatılar kırmızı, turuncu, ve açık kahverengi. O beyaz, eski ve tarihi bir minare. Şimdi yolar sessiz ama genellikle kalabalık. Şimdi hava soğuk ama genellikle hava sıcak.

I promote this city in Turkish as my assignments since I was student of Turkish Studies, Graduate School of Ibn Haldun University, Turkey. This is my best city ever in my live for taking my bachelor degree in Gadjah Mada University as best university in Indonesia. Through international exposure, I can see the world by my own shoes. I met all of people from many places, like from other provinces in Indonesia. This place is totally miniature of Indonesia. Hence, I met international student a lot to gain other perspectives and exchange experiences through discussion. I really had great memories a lot to be here. Now, I am still in Yogyakarta as freelancer of multilingual teacher (Indonesia, Javanese, English). I am still learning other languages, like Japanese, Spanish, and Turkish. I put this experiences as my best memories part of my life. It sucks since I cant be there and continue my master-degree. But it is worth to wait, be patience, and struggle AGAIN pursuing my barakah dream.
