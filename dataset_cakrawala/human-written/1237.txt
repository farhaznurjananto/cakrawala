I’ve seen a few people share their work setups / processes lately, so I thought I would do the same!Here is a photo of what my office looks like today. I need a tidy space to be in the right mindset to get work done 😅 … features Phillips Hue lighting, 4K TV, Mini Ping Pong Table, Stereo Pair HomePods, 5k iMac…5k iMac (4Ghz i7), 16GB RAM, 512GB Flash Storage.I really love my 5k iMac. The display alone is worth $1,000, and the computer itself is still fast enough to easily handle everything I need to do.When traveling or working outside of the house, I use a 2017 Retina MacBook Pro with TouchBar. I honestly like this machine quite a bit even though it’s gotten some negative reviews. I’ve gotten more used to the keyboard with time and the TouchBar doesn’t bother me. The screen is amazing.If I need to use Windows, I have a Surface Book 2.I use an iPhone XS Max as my primary phone.I use SublimeText 3 as my primary editor. I pair it with the Inspired GitHub color scheme, Operator Mono font, SublimeLinter, and a handful of keyboard short-cuts to run PHPUnit tests (https://github.com/adamwathan/sublime-phpunit). I also make heavy use of Sublime’s “project” features and the Cmd+Shift+P short-cut to quick-switch between projects.I use iTerm2 as my terminal. I use oh-my-zsh’s default command prompt combined with the “Arthur” color scheme:I use Todoist a lot. All day, every day. I primarily sit on the “Today” view and delegate tasks from there. I use the “smart date” parsing when scheduling tasks to quickly assign tasks a given date / time:I use Laravel Valet to configure my Nginx / PHP environment. The speed and ease-of-use is hard to beat. If I need to run a project within Docker (typically when using Windows), I like to use Vessel.I primarily use Telegram and Discord for communication. I’ve managed to get my entire family on Telegram 😅 and most of my Laravel communication these days takes place on the official Laravel Discord server.For headphones, I primarily use my AirPods but I love the Bose QC35 when traveling or when I need to drown out some noise.I use Spotify for music streaming, and primarily listen to deep / prog house electronic and rap. If you want to get a feel for what I might be listening to on any given workday, check out these playlists:Here are some other applications I use a lot:
