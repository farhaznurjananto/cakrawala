The Trump Prophecy: Why MAGA Can’t Listen to Reason

Trump is more than human in the minds of his supporters

In 2011, Mark Taylor, a retired firefighter from Orlando, heard the voice of God. Taylor had been struggling with PTSD following a house fire that had killed a young boy; he frequently dreamed of the child’s burnt countenance thereafter; demonic entities also haunted Taylor’s visions.

That’s when God spoke to him. The Almighty told Taylor that Donald Trump would soon be President, and assured him that the vile and bombastic game show host would bring healing and peace to the nation.

That’s the story Liberty University is telling, anyway. The 2018 film, The Trump Prophecy, was financed by the Republican party’s most devoted institution of higher learning; it dramatizes Taylor’s selection into the ranks of Moses, Elijah, and St. Paul.

While Taylor is the film’s protagonist, his personal story clearly isn’t the point. Rather, the audience takeaway is that Donald Trump is God’s handpicked President, selected to restore Christian virtues to a degenerate America.

It isn’t really Trump, you see, that will Make America Great Again. It is God.
