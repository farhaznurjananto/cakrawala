Ides

this is why I need to scatter your pieces

Today I want to break

vessels that don’t belong to me —

not for dominance,

nor revenge

but to know who’s real.

Vigilance makes me weary.

If I prick you, will you bleed

or keep your drops close

— are you that spare

Or vindictive?

Are you banking

for future battles

— do you find me

unworthy?

The scales are a gift —

weight from my father;

my mother gave me

the blindfold.

I see only disparity.

I don’t carry shame

house to house

but I keep finding it

on my stoop.

Drones promise belonging

in the form of boxes

unacceptably shaped,

no return address.

This is precisely why

I need to scatter your pieces.
