The arid spells are a distant memory

Gone the days of skies empty and barren

Or bristling air of all moistness shorn,

When all forward hope was a futility.

No more are clogged the inner doors,

No more collides the haphazard world

Onto the unwary heart most unprepared,

A quiet resonance most subtly grows

To the hidden vasts behind and above.

Not content with my wake now invades

My erstwhile unconscious sleep and dreams

With a lustrous hint of aspiring love.

Who knew an absence could sweet

be, upending the very basis of desire,

What strange lacking fuels this new fire

That flaming sings in itself content.

I who wailed for a fond face drifting

In the course of life currents swift,

Now passively watch worlds swept

By surging purpose in a luminous seeing.

Such are the preludes of my self-unfolding,

A footnote minor on the pages of Becoming.
