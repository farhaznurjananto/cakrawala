Portugal and Some of its’ Cities — Part 1

My Life in Portugal in the ‘50s

After serving through WW1 and WW2, my journalist Father decided that he wanted to settle his family in a neutral country. Portugal was his pick.

So, that is how in 1951, we bundled into our small Hillman Minx car, packed to capacity with my Father, my Mother and I, plus all of our suitcases, and my toys, and began the drive from London, England to eventually arrive in Lisbon Portugal.

We did not go straight there. We had to cross the Channel to get from England to France. We stopped in France. Stayed in Paris for a short time, travelled through Chateau country and then to Spain and finally through the Estrela mountains to arrive in Portugal.

It must have been an exhausting drive for my Father, even though we stopped frequently, staying over in lots of small hotels and pensions.

The first town we stopped in once we crossed into Portugal from Spain was the town of Guarda.
