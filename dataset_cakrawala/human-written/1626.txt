NASA has just publicly released the first videos taken by the Perseverance rover and the first sounds ever recorded from the surface of Mars. The rover landed on Mars last Thursday, the end of a journey that began last July. On the spacecraft’s way down to the planet’s surface, it snapped images and recorded a wealth of video footage that has given us a historic view of the nail-biting landing.

The landing footage: The three-and-a-half minute video stitches together footage of the rover’s landing recorded by five different cameras, starting from about 9.5 kilometers above the surface and as it descends. The red landscape is shown in exquisite detail, with dotted hills, ledges, craters and small valleys coming into closer focus as the rover fell.

Sounding off: Perseverance also made history by taking the first audio recording on Mars. A snippet of noise was made available that includes the sound of 5 mph winds blowing through the Martian landscape
