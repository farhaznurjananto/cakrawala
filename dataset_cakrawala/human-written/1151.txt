English translation

May the partridge cross my musket’s view,

Dog signs at her with haughty airs.

— El Alano, XVIIth century anonymous poem.

You don’t need 3 heads to dwell in myths;

A migration from Iran to Spain;

& Molossian phenotypes are enough to

Horrorize…ay, bendito*, the canine horror.

You don’t need the Cynologique seal;

You gnawed taíno bones & nightmares

From The Conquest reverberate in your blood —

The horror…ay, bendito, the canine horror.

You had your fill of human flesh:

Men — women — children…

You were an efficient machine.

They said: “The dog deserves human rations!”

Ponce said: “Canine Piety is not Christian doctrine”.

Your service to The Crown made you legend.
