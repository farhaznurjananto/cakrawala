We witnessed plenty of action in the first major event of the 2016 motorsport season, the Rolex 24 at Daytona, and though it wasn’t a miracle run for Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] and its new GT supercar, another American automaker, Chevrolet, took home the top honors in the GT category. The pair of C7.Rs from Corvette Racing managed a one-two finish. Relive all the action in our mega gallery post.

Another new Porsche spotted this week was the second-generation Panamera, though this time it had a completely new bodystyle. The general shape looks virtually identical to what we saw on the awesome Panamera Sport Turismo concept of 2012, though camouflage gear still hides some of the detail.
