Could the latest 2014 Lexus IS spawn a new-generation of the SportCross?
According to Lexus it may.
The automaker recently posted an image of the original 2003 IS 300 SportCross on its Facebook page along with the message: “Do you remember the ‘02 IS 300 SportCross with its style, utility and performance? Will we bring it back? Watch the 2014 IS premiere on Facebook in 6 days to find out!”
Though it’s not quite full confirmation of the vehicle, it does strongly suggest that an announcement on a new IS SportCross could be made soon. The IS premiere is currently scheduled for January 15.
The original model, launched between the 2002 and 2005 model years, was never a top seller despite its positive attributes. The car combined stylish good looks with a practical wagon body and rear-wheel-drive dynamics, which at the time should have ticked all the right boxes for enthusiasts, but for some reason it fizzled and sales were eventually discontinued.
A new SportCross based on the latest 2014 Lexus IS is certainly an interesting proposition. Revealed this week ahead of its official debut at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the new sedan adopts aggressive looks, a similar powertrain lineup to the outgoing model, and a driver-focused interior inspired by the design from the Lexus LFA supercar.  
We should have more details on both the new IS as well as its possible SportCross spin-off once press days for the Detroit show kick off next Monday. In the meantime, make sure to bookmark our dedicated show page in case if you haven’t already.
