After I wrote about making $50,000 in 2021 using my intuition to help me invest in stocks, I woke up in the middle of the night with the thought, “If my intuition can make me $50K, it can just as well help me make $500K.”

The thought may have been too rich for my blood a few years ago, but as I laid in bed that night, I could see $500K as a distinct possibility as I drifted back to sleep.

Last night, my midnight awakening reminded me of a line from Science of Getting Rich.

If you have failed, it is because you have failed to ask for it largely.

Had I mocked or insulted God / Universe, who speaks to me via my intuition by asking for only $50,000?

Later, I woke up with the memory of my children gifting me a flying lesson for my 50th birthday. I remembered my long-ago dream of flying an airplane and starting an aero-limousine business. Dormant desires seem to be awakening within me.

The next morning, when I looked at my phone, I saw a YouTube video from Marisa Peer in my timeline, How to set & achieve ANY GOAL in your life. She says not to set reasonable goals. Instead, she says, set bold and audacious goals that take you out of your comfort zone.

She says, don’t just set goals to make a lot of money; visualize all the great things you’ll accomplish with that money and all the difference you will make in the world.

One of the core desires in my life has always been to be God’s instrument of generosity.
