The passage of the FinReg bill, which is likely to happen as soon as it hits President Obama’s desk, has involved efforts from all types — from banking-industry lobbyists, to finance experts to rulemakers up and down the halls of Congress.

Now, get ready for the lawyers.

Joanna Slater, writing in the Toronto Globe & Mail, reports on the eager beavers — the lawyers — just waiting to get their hands on the law, and get paid for helping their clients make sense of it. Writes Slater:

At 2,300 pages, the finance bill is massive, complex, and riddled with areas that beg for further interpretation. In hundreds of places, it requires regulators to fashion rules which have yet to be written. Making sense of the new way of doing business is going to keep lawyers very, very busy for months, and likely years, to come.

So where will the work . . .
