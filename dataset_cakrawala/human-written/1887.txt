We hope that your holidays are going well! We are on the last stretch of 2016, and what a skinned knees type of year it has been. We don’t know about you, but we are absolutely looking forward to seeing what 2017 will bring.

We would like to let you also know that the membership is live, so please feel free to sign up! While you may think there are not a lot of reasons to do so, we think there is. It will help us dedicate more time to Literally Literary, not just through editing, but using the funds to put together a print publication featuring all of our wonderful writers! Along with giveaways, a Slack Channel dedicated to members, and other benefits we think up as we try this out!

On a personal note, it is my goal to be able to feature the print publication in my biggest personal project, Literally Literary-Akron’s Lit House; a brick and mortar haven for writers, readers, and dreamers!

We also have launched our Facebook page and Instagram account for LL, because, you know, that’s what young folks do these days right? :)

Next week we will also resume our Literally Last Week newsletters as well! We hope that you have a fabulous holiday season!

Stay warm, stay sane, stay safe!
