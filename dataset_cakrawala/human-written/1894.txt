7 : 0 7 AM

You roll over,

check the news

from your bulletproof bed

and then convince yourself that:

“there are so many of them marching out

in the streets — most can’t end up dead.”

You squeeze yourself onto the subway

already somehow starting to sweat,

while you will some brave

soon-to-be martyrs

to not become

just yet.

8 : 2 5 AM

Enough

slow tourists

mean you won’t be

at work on-time, so you

shoot gaps like running backs,

while one thought runs through your mind:

I guess at least enough of them lived long enough

to raise a generation carrying freedom

and fight as recessive genes.

You decide you like this

new office coffee

machine.

9 : 3 6 AM

While it’s

espresso pods

help you shake off the

morning weed, you learn just

how much someone’s eye can bleed

— at least when it’s shot with a bean bag

at close range, by police who are

effectively brainwashed and

sufficiently trained.

You wonder if

it leaves

a stain.

(she’ll

see

with

her

one

eye)

1 1 : 1 1 AM

You lie,

and run off

to the closest empty

conference room to answer

a call. It’s your love, half a hard world away.

You grit your teeth when the call drops before

you can really hear what she really has to say.

Walking back you decide you think you

would stay. Fight back in a black

face mask. Get your head

cracked. But theres no

time with these

meetings

all day.

6 : 4 6 PM

But life’s okay,

because you’re high

before you go back underground.

Eyes full of smoke. Ears full of sound.

You can’t hear the screaming in the street

anymore. Can’t feel the ground shake

as they chant in the airport. Can’t

see the girls face as they rip

off her pants and spray

her with mace.

6 : 5 4 PM

Honestly,

it’s a fucking disgrace —

how long these trains delay.

You turn the music up louder now

and close the article you never got to:

The one with the title “here’s what you can do.”

You’re thirsty from the job you sort of

hate, so you hit the bar on the way

home. The one where other

outraged hearts rage

out hurt parts, and

replace them

with booze.

1 0 : 1 0 PM

“They’ll lose” You

slur with confidence.

“And they’ll die.” You sigh as

if being a pessimist protects anyone

in any way. Another death another day.

Another drink, another way for you to play

pretend. As if someone’s life didn’t end.

As if marching or social media

mattered. Somewhere, they

are bruised and battered

Just like your liver.

The next day

you shiver.

7 : 0 7 AM (again)

You roll over,

check the news from

your blood-free bed. Then

take a little longer to leave it.
