In cooperation with the Israeli government, an Israeli NGO, Shurat Hadin â€“ The Israel Law Center, is preparing the infrastructure for taking senior members of the Palestinian Authority to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for their role and participation in terror attacks, according to a report in Makor Rishon.

The claims will be submitted to the court if Palestinian Authority president, Abu Mazen, decides to launch a lawfare attack against Israel at the ICJ. The Palestinian Authority has been threatening to take Israel to the Hague since its status was upgraded in the UN.

Israel has begun taking multiple retaliatory steps in response to the Palestinian Authority breaching the peace talks agreement by taking unilateral actions by applying to various UN groups, and refusing to extend the talks.

Shurat HaDin, an Israeli NGO that defends the legal rights of terror victims, initiated the idea. Various Israeli government offices will be assisting Shurat HaDin in preparing the lawsuits against senior Palestinian Authority officials in the ICJ.

Last year Shurat HaDin began a series of high profile lawsuits in the U.S. against the PA and others involved in terrorism against Israelis. A few of the cases resulted in judgement with high payouts to the victims.

Nitzana Dershan-Leitner, who founded and runs Shurat HaDin, says the purpose of preparing these lawsuits is to discourage the PA from filing any lawsuits in the Hague.

Dershan-Leitner said that as soon as the ICJ Criminal Court recognizes the Palestinian Authority and allows them to sue Israel, it then creates a two-way street, and which allows the PA and its officials to be sued in return, in the same court. The [terrorist] crimes the PA and its officials have committed is far worse than anything they are claiming against Israel.

Dershan-Leitner added that Shurat HaDin has clear documentation in its possession as to who committed and who is behind each terror attack
