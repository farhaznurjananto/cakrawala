Nissan unveiled the 2017 GT-R Nismo; we spied the interior of the 2017 Porsche Panamera; and the IIHS crash tested a trio of American muscle cars. It's the Week in Reverse, right here on Motor Authority.
Nissan gave the GT-R its most extensive refresh yet for the 2017 model year, and now it's doing the same with the GT-R Nismo. Featuring updated styling, tech, and performance, the new GT-R Nismo should be better than ever.
Ford and Shelby are bringing back the Hertz "Rent-a-Racer" program with the new 2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT-H. Starting this holiday weekend you'll be able to rent the new Shelby GT-H at 17 airport Hertz rental locations.
We spied the interior or the new 2017 Porsche Panamera which features almost an entirely buttonless design. That's a large departure for the Panamera, as the current model has a sea of buttons on the center stack and console. Will this new interface be a catastrophe? Only time will tell.
The IIHS put the three American muscle cars through a full battery of crash tests, and the cars didn't perform as well as one might hope. The Challenger--the oldest of the trio--fared the worst, as the driver's seat had to be unbolted to remove the crash-test dummy after the small front overlap test.
The Verano will bow out of Buick's U.S. lineup this year. Low margins and falling demand for sedans have made it hard to justify a sales case for the next Verano here in the U.S. market. Look for Buick to turn more of its focus to SUVs.
