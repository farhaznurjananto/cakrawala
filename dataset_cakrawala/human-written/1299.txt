“God wants you to be in the world but so different from the world that you will change it. Get cracking.” — Mother Angelica

Never think that you can’t do anything to change the world. You can always do something, and you can always start where you are.

Sometimes we tend to think that only the big people can change the world — the rich ones, the influential ones, the powerful ones.

But you have power deep within you. Power from above which no one could ever take away.

You can do something. You can change from within and you can be that spark of hope you wish to see.

Remember that it took but one Man to overcome death forever and save all mankind. It took but one Man to restore paradise and blot out sin forever.

Wake up from your slumber and make an offering of yourself. Do everything you can. And leave the rest to Him who can still make miracles happen.
