One of the most anticipated cars of the coming year, the 2014 Chevrolet Corvette, or "C7" as it's known to fans, is set to be revealed for the first time on January 13 before making an appearance at the Detroit Auto Show the very next day.
In the lead up to its arrival, Chevrolet is dropping bits of information to help quell the anticipation of the legions of fans desperate to see the car finally unveiled.
Recently, the automaker revealed the new crossed flags emblem that would appear on the car. It then followed up with details on the 2014 Corvette’s 6.2-liter 'LT1' V-8 engine. Its also released a previous teaser video (pasted below) showing several stages of the car’s development.
Now, Chevrolet has started a new trailer series for the 2014 Corvette, with the first episode explaining how the car’s exterior was sculpted for optimal aerodynamic performance.
“Every line, every vent, every millimeter performs,” one of the car’s designers explains.
One aspect Chevrolet is keen to point out is that only two very superficial components will be shared between the outgoing C6 and new C7: an air filter and a latch.
Our own spy shots show a smaller but much more dynamic shape for the 2014 Corvette. While the overall proportions look the same, sharper lines and improved attention to detail should make it a stunning looking sports car. And with the base model coming with 450 horsepower on tap, it should be a stunning performer as well.   
In addition to these new trailers, Chevrolet has also launched a microsite that will host all the videos being released right up until the January 13 reveal.
