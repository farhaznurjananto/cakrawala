Microsoft has announced Xbox One games in the UK will come with a Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of £49.99.

OXM spotted the prices on the company's online store, which currently lists Dead Rising 3, Ryse: Son of Rome, Forza Motorsport 5 and Kinect Sports Rivals for that price.

Last month, Microsoft announced that first-party Xbox One games would be sold in North America for $59.99, which is the same price games are currently sold for there. In terms of the UK, it's worth remembering that retailers are likely to undercut Microsoft - in fact, Amazon is already listing Need for Speed Rivals at £43.99.

Sony has yet to announce any UK pricing for its games, though the company has similarly confirmed an American price point of $59.99.
