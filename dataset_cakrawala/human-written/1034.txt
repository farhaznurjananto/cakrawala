Bugatti CEO Wolfgang Dürheimer has revealed that the maker of the Veyron and Chiron hypercars is considering a new model line, and there are as many as four possibilities for what it could be.
The information was revealed by Dürheimer during a recent interview with Drive, and though he wasn’t willing to say what the four possibilities were he did say one of them was a sedan along the lines of the Galibier 16C concept unveiled in 2009.
The others are thought to be an SUV, a more accessible supercar, and an electric car of some sort. Crucially, all of them would have higher volumes than the Veyron and Chiron.
Dürheimer said his favorite option is the sedan. Plans for the Galibier were canned while Dürheimer’s predecessor Wolfgang Schreiber was running the show. But with Dürheimer now at the helm there’s a push for a new type of Bugatti, either to be sold alongside the Chiron or after the hypercar’s run.
Dürheimer explained that a new model line was important to shoring up the finances of the brand. Bugatti famously lost money on each Veyron it sold, although that was allowed to pass as the car’s world-beating abilities shone positively on the rest of the Volkswagen Group. But with the tighter scrutiny at the automaker post the diesel emissions cheating scandal, those days are over.
“Part of the decision to keep Bugatti within the portfolio of brands overseen by the Volkswagen Group was tied to assurances that it would provide suitable return on investment within its next phase of operation,” a source told Drive.
