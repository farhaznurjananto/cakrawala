All Media Outlets Have an Agenda

Is it possible to only consume the facts?

You’re no longer watching or reading the news. The news you consume is a new product created from facts that become mixed with someone else’s biases. How it’s told and presented is more important than ‘what’ is told or presented.

The truth is, social media has killed the news industry. Your friend’s post on Facebook saying “I’m safe from the earthquake in Taipei” tells you two things. They are safe – and there’s been an earthquake in Taipei.

That second part used to be the job of traditional media outlets. Now their business of broadcasting has been automated by the public.

To produce the revenue-generating attention they’re used to receiving, they sensationalize everything. Anonymous sources come forward with unreported, uninvestigated rape allegations, Ellen’s staff don’t like their bosses (shock) and Trump’s latest tweet is the reason for hundreds of years of oppression.

True or not, every single media outlet has an agenda.

Once you understand that your mind becomes an impregnable fortress of serenity. It’s not what they’re saying, it’s how and why they’re saying it now… For more money, that’s why.

Media outlets are a business, not a public service.
