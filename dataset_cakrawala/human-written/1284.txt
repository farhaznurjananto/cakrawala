The F-Type was Jaguar's first true sports car in a generation, and the legendary firm hit it out of the park. So much so, we pretty much find the car to be perfect, particularly in R performance guise. For 2017, the package gets even better, as it's a bit cheaper to step up to an F-Type and there’s also a new SVR model packing 575 horsepower at the top of the range.
Jaguar has released full pricing for its 2017 F-Type and the starting price now comes in at $62,395. That’s for a coupe with rear-wheel drive, a manual transmission and a 340-horsepower supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. The convertible with this same setup now starts at $66,395. Both those figures include a $995 destination charge and mean prices have dropped $3,600 and $2,700, respectively. The move is part of Jaguar's plan to sharpen prices across its lineup.

An eight-speed automatic is available on the base F-Type but if you want all-wheel drive you’ll need to step up to the F-Type S, powered by a 380-hp supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. You’ll also need to forget about owning a manual as all-wheel-drive F-Types only come with the auto. Above this are the F-Type R with a 550-hp supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 and the aforementioned F-Type SVR with the same V-8 as the F-Type R but a 575-hp rating.
Along with the price drop, there are also some new standard features, including a valet mode and six-way adjustable seats. Other standard goodies include the Meridian 770-watt surround sound audio system, satellite navigation, SiriusXM satellite radio, leather and suede-cloth trim, sports seats and Jaguar InControl Apps infotainment.
The F-Type is also covered by Jaguar's impressive EliteCare service, which covers all scheduled maintenance for five years or 60,000 miles, so there won't be any excuse for new owners not to attack their local twisties.
The 2017 Jaguar F-Type will hit showrooms by late spring. The SVR will arrive in the summer.
