Whether you’re laughing or crying, hungry for a burger or ramen, or planning a night out or a night in, sometimes it’s just easier to say it with an emoji. Starting today, it’s going to be even simpler to find the perfect emojis and stickers in Google Allo. And for the first time, you’re going to be able to bring the magic of J.K. Rowling’s “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” right to your chats.

Smart Smiley helps you say 👋

Sometimes you need a little help finding the right emoji. With so many out there, it’s no wonder that most of the time, we only use a handful (less than 3%!) of all emojis. That’s why we’ve added a new feature to Google Allo to make it easier to find and send the perfect emoji or sticker. Just tap the Smart Smiley button as you’re typing a message, we’ll suggest relevant emojis and stickers to help you finish your thought. So if you’re planning dinner with a friend, you may see 🍔, 🍕, or 🍤. Or if you type “see you later” we’ll offer to complete that thought with 🐊.
