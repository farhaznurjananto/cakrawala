There's no denying the performance and racing heritage of Panoz cars, but the aesthetics...well, they take some getting used to. Don Panoz, founder of the Panoz Motor Sports Group, unveiled the car today at the lead-up to this weekend's 24 Hours of Le Mans race at the Circuit de la Sarthe in France. Just 81 of the special-edition cars will be built, one for each year of the running of the Le Mans endurance race from 1923 to 2013, the car's final year of production.
Despite looks that consist of equal parts Speed Racer Mach 5, Batmobile, and Panoz Esperante GT, there's no mistaking this car for any other. And with 600 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque on tap, it'll give just about anything out there a run for its money as well. Each chassis will be linked to one specific year of the Le Mans race, with the chassis number containing the race date and the initials of the winning drivers among other details.
The ownership experience will also befit its limited-production, supercar status: delivery at the Circuit de la Sarthe, professional instruction on the Bugatti Circuit at Le Mans, a parade lap around the 8.3-mile race circuit, tickets to the 24 Hours of Le Mans as guests of the ACO and Panoz, and a special reception at the clubhouse of the Golf Des 24 Heures in Arnage.
