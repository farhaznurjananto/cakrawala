After you’ve been food blogging for a while, you find that friends and family start consulting with you on culinary issues. I’ve been at this for a mere ten months, and although I’ve been cooking away for twenty or so years at this point, I’m suddenly the go-to girl for healthy vegetarian food advice. Oh, I’m not complaining. I absolutely dig it. In fact, I’ve noticed myself lately doling out food advice to strangers, which is very much unlike my typical introverted self. I hear someone asking the clerk at the produce stand what to do with asparagus and find myself chiming in “Oh, if you want a quick and dirty cooking method just wrap it in a wet paper towel and zap it for a couple of minutes, but if you’ve got more time you should definitely pan sear it with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar.” Where’d that come from? So unlike me. And everyone says the internet is depleting our ability to interact in person. Little do they know.

Anyhow, my boyfriend’s sister recently asked me for some help with ingredients for a cleanse she was planning on trying, one of those ingredients being quinoa, which the cleanse protocol instructed her to eat for breakfast. Of course I gave her some input, and then of course I woke up the next morning with quinoa on the brain, and it being the holiday season and all, this recipe was born.

I checked back with the boyfriend’s sis on how her breakfast quinoa turned out and she gave it a “meh” sort of review. Something along the lines of “It was okay, but not really good in that ‘mmmm…I want more of this’ kind of way.” This recipe has some sugar and nuts, so it’s maybe not quite cleanse worthy. On the other had it’s tasty enough that you’ll want some more, but healthy enough so that you won’t feel awful if you do go for those seconds. And really, if you do have seconds you’d just be filling up on healthy stuff so you don’t get too freaky with the Christmas cookies later on. It’s all good.
