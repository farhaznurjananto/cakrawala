The year 2013 marked the return of the Dodge--excuse us, the SRT--Viper.
Whatever its brand name may be, we're happy to live in a world in which a car can head to market with an 8.4-liter V-10 engine that produces 640 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque.
The Viper has already earned its place in history as one of the most iconic American sports cars of all time. Now it's back for another model year, with some extra color choices and a brand-new setting that directs the traction control to keep you chugging along in the rain.
Three new exterior paint options are being rolled out for the 2014 SRT Viper. The first is Billet Silver, which mimics the main paint scheme of the GTS-R racecar. Also, the darker blue accent color used on the GTS-R is now offered as a full shade for street car and it's called GTS-R Blue. Finally, if a Viper buyer opts for the GTS and then checks the box for the Anodized Carbon Special Edition, the car will wear a matte-black exterior coat.
More important than the exterior color is the addition of a new traction control calibration. The system can now be placed into Rain Mode, which helps keep the car composed on wet and dry roads. Since the Viper wears rather aggressive Pirelli P Zero rubber, it's smart to have a setting like this for the car.
There aren't a lot of details on the new calibration at the moment, but we'd guess that the system reduces the throttle on initial pedal application to lower the amount of torque flowing to the wheels. The SRT team says this mode is also good for showing a new Viper driver how to operate the car before letting him or her loose on the full standard traction mode.
