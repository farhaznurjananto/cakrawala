If everything with the Atlanta Falcons is broken, don't fix it. That's the message New Orleans Saints fans have for their hated NFC South nemesis.

A New Orleans sports talk station started a Twitter campaign for the struggling Falcons to keep head coach Mike Smith complete with a #SaveSmitty hashtag amid rumors he might soon be fired.

The Falcons are 2-6 on the season and have lost their last five games, including a 21-point collapse Sunday in London against the Detroit Lions.

Smith coached the Falcons to the playoffs in four of his first five seasons, but have gone 6-18 in the 24 games since their NFC title game appearance in January 2013.

So, go ahead and ignore the fact the Falcons beat the Saints earlier this season and read more Tweets with the #SaveSmitty hashtag HERE.
