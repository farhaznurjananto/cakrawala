What type of traveler are you? Do you go to relax, to get away from it all or is it a pilgrimage for the soul?

I absolutely love travel for many reasons but as I reflect right now, mostly because it has the power to expand our horizon! That is, if we allow the experience to affect us. Whether it’s savoring new foods, colorful cultures, ancient temples or soaking in breathtaking scenery, I seem to come away looking at life a little different, like shifting a prism slightly and seeing everything change! Everyone and everything seem to become more beautiful. For that reason, there’s never been a single trip that I’ve regretted. They’ve all been eye opening, helped build character, and have been a window to the soul.

I’m reminded of one my favorite quotes on travel. This was from the late, great Anthony Bourdain. God, I miss that guy! Anyway, his words are still alive and ring loudly, “Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” — Anthony Bourdain

That is to say, there’s no wrong way to travel, just go! ❤️
