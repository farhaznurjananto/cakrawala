‘Go Grab It’

For the past couple of days, I had the privilege of joining a few others for a course — (online-obvs).

The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, in partnership with the World Trade Centre Vancouver, offers a variety of programs for business owners who are interested in learning more about importing and/or exporting goods.

Whether you’ve been in the game for years or just starting out, there is something for everyone.

Through the decades of growing in business understanding and pivoting along the way to adjust to life circumstances, I’ve come across some positive individuals and groups of helpful people and others who, uh…have offered challenges for me to grow from.

Both are needed, both types are helpful.

In the last year, there have been a few organizations and people who have been extra helpful. To share with those who may not already know about these opportunities available, here are some: (note they may be Indigenous-ownership or women specific)

The Export Navigator program

T.A.P — Canada’s Trade Accelerator Program

I.C.E — Integrated E-Commerce Essentials

Community Futures Thompson Country

Community Futures Development Corporation of Central Interior *First Nations

All Nations Trust Co.

Women’s Enterprise Centre

While this list is not exhaustive, it’s a good start for the ever-growing and changing world we live in.

Businesses great or small, no matter where in B.C. you operate can benefit from the opportunities these organizations offer.

If you need some guidance on who to ask or where to turn, I’m happy to help.

Up and to the right.
