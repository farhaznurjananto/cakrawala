Top Trending shared a video from Dying Light: The Following that shows us the different kinds of zombies pop culture has seen over the years. The video begins with the “voodoo zombie” of 1932 (Béla Lugosi’s Murder Legendre) and the “Living Dead” of 1968, and moves forward to the bloodier Biters and “Z zombies” or recent years. The final zombie type is the volatile type from the Dying Light game.

The make-up team did a fantastic job, especially on last few zombies! It’s interesting to see how the zombie’s body and face became more distorted over time (obviously with some exceptions). Do you have a favorite zombie? I’m partial the the Living Dead-type myself.
