Problem: If your D3 script has a data file loaded in (e.g. d3.csv) when you open the HTML, it will fail to read the data because most browsers don’t allow XMLHttpRequest or fetch requests to local files.

D3 error message — fail to read data

Solution 1: Set up a local server

There are a couple of options to set up a local server, but I used the HTTP-server in the command line below(Github page).

#run as an administrator to get around permission limitation

sudo -i #install http-server globally

npm install -g http-server #go to the directory of your D3 files

cd /Users/ChiHuang/Documents/d3 #activate the http-server

http-server &

You should see the link to the local servers now.

URL of the local server

Go to either URL in the browser, then you can open files in the directory.

Files in D3 directory

Solution 2: Use IDE’s extensions

If you use an IDE like Visual Studio Code (Free), you should be able to find extensions that allow you to debug/run on your local server and even see the changes live in a browser (Live Server).
