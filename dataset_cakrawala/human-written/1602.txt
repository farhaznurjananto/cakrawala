A Solstice Poem

Prompt: Reason to rejoice

Solitary weeks turned into solitary months

Solemn pandemic clutches the heart

As solstice approaches, the longest night yet

Might a solution be finally near at hand?

Businesses, both solvent and insolvent

Sold their ways, unable to abide

As the solar journey lengthens its stride

Solely we stand, weary but resilient,

on the cusp of solace.
