An engaged media watching audience

Imagine creating an entire twenty-episode TV series but having dismal viewership. Furthermore, an even worse scenario is to face your hard work getting lost in today’s saturated content shuffle and never finding its way to an audience. With other streaming platforms set to release a whopping count of 700 original shows in 2018 alone, filmmakers must now fight tooth and nail to reel in committed viewers and a stable paycheck.

Enter Spokkz, Spuul’s attempt to protect its filmmakers by securing them a committed audience and a stable profit flow. By introducing Spokkz, an ICO, to its content streaming platform, Spuul is forging a close collaboration between content creators and their audience. Content creators will be pre-funded by SPKZ tokens; they can focus on producing their best hits with a peace of mind while having a committed audience awaiting their releases.

Content creators working with Spokkz will enjoy the security of tokenised pre-funding, viewership profits and an appreciative audience to support their finished works — just about everything a creator could possibly dream of.
