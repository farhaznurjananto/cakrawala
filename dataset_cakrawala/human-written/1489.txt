Developing a Growth Mindset

Difference B/W Growth and Fixed Mindset

“The mind is just like a muscle — the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand.”

Mindset is an approach to determine the ability of a person to solve a problem or to grow up in his field or to check the leadership qualities. There are two types of Mindset. One is Fixed mindset and the other is Growth mindset. These two types are quite different from each other. Let’s have a small view on both types.

Fixed mindset is a type of mindset which accept no change. A person having fixed mindset is a person having no mission in his life. He has been locked his mind on some specific things and he never gonna change his mindset.

On the other hand Growth mindset is a type of mindset which always accept change. A person having growth mindset lives a live full of joy. He always accept challenges and try to find out any solution for each problem he faces. Here are some Amaltotaky which are shared below to develop a growth mindset.
