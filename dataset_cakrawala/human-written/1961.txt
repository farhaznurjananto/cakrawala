Cleveland is a dynamic city with an industrial past and an exciting future in healthcare and innovation. Given its history, I was curious about the placement of older homes throughout the city. In order for a home to be considered for the National Register of Historic Places, it needs to be at least 50 years old. Knowing the locations of older homes provides a quick estimate for the level of effort needed to assess the areas prior to development. In addition, development plans can be tailored to the preservation or reuse of these homes.
