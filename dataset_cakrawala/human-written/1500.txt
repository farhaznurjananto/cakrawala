Zack’s “Quick” Rundown: So every week, I go through the full depth chart of every team and update with injuries. The Niners had a handful of people out last week (won 31–13 vATL), and it didn’t change much this week. So keep that in mind when thinking what Niners team you’ll get tonight. The Titans however are a bit mixed, with a few important guys coming back like WR1 AJ Brown and [now] CB2 Janoris “Jackrabbit” Jenkins, but will be without LT Taylor Lewan and possibly WR2 Julio Jones. Taking all of that into consideration, the fact that both teams are in playoff range, and we have a road favorite…I have no idea what is going to happen haha. I think I’m leaning towards the Titans with the points, because I think they can keep it close. I really like the idea of D’Onta Foreman, AJ Brown and Julio, BUT Julio is TBD tonight and that means I have to rely on Tannehill protecting the ball. That dude is tied for the lead in Interceptions at 14 (through 14 games) and is -138 to throw one tonight. Eesh. I’m nervous about the Niners DLine against a crippled Titans OLine though, so I’ll take the Niners straight up.

Position Faceoff (I’m lazy and haven’t got to update injuries from the rest of the teams, so keep that in mind): 8–5 San Francisco 49ers
