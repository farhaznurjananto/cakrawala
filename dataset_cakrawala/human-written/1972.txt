The wagon version of the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, or ‘Estate’ as it’s known in Europe, was first revealed nearly two years ago but the U.S. is just getting its first taste of the furious family hauler, which has just come onto the market as a 2012 model. To get us all excited once again, we have this stunning mega-gallery of images showing the new E63 AMG Wagon in all its glory.
While the U.S. has missed out on the car for the past couple of years, we're starting with the latest version complete with AMG’s new twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter V-8 and a healthy 518 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. That horsepower figure may be down on the 525 horses of AMG’s previous 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V-8, but torque is up by 51 pound-feet.
Of course, if this is still not enough, AMG offers an optional performance package for all you diehards, which bumps the fun to 550 horsepower and 590 pound-feet.
Even with its supercar like output, the E63 AMG Wagon is pretty darn fuel-efficient, thanks in part to an engine stop-start system. Whenever the AMG model has its transmission in 'Controlled Efficiency Mode' and comes to a stop in "D" or "N" with the brake pedal depressed, the engine is automatically turned off to save fuel.
As soon as the driver touches the accelerator pedal, the engine computer decides which piston is in the best position for first ignition, and the direct fuel injection and multi-spark systems work with a starter motor to re-start the engine almost instantly. EPA figures are yet to be released.
For the interior, you also get AMG's excellent attention to detail, as well, meaning an upgrade over even the standard high-end E-Class in terms of style and materials. It also gets a standard panoramic sunroof. Mix in the available Designo custom colors and you have a recipe for a truly impressive wagon.
