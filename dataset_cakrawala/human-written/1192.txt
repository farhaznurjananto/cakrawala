GRAND RAPIDS, MI â€” U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Cascade Township, soon will sit down with us and answer a few reader questions. That's where you come in. West Michigan's libertarian-minded congressman is slated to join MLive and The Grand Rapids Press for an interview on Friday, June 6. The one-on-one is expected to start around 11:30 a.m., with stories running online shortly thereafter.

Poll:

Have something on your mind? Amash currently is serving his second term in Washington, D.C., as representative for Michigan's 3rd District. He's also working to secure the Republican nomination for a possible third term against local businessman Brian Ellis in the Aug. 5 primary.

, Amash also has spent time publicizing votes on Facebook and railing against the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs. Perhaps a few questions within these subjects will crop up, too. Post your questions in the comments section below, and we'll sort through a few to ask the congressman toward the end of Friday's interview. We'll also prod him to jump into the comments himself to answer questions we couldn't get to. Join us again later for more coverage.
