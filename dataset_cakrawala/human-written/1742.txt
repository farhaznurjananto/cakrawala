The Specialty Equipment Manufacturer's Association show in Las Vegas is best know as the showcase for performance and customization parts from aftermarket suppliers. However, the mainstream automakers use the show to introduce new models and accessory parts of their own. At this year's show, Chevrolet went all-out with a blitz of Chevrolet Performance Parts for the Camaro, Corvette, Cruze, Sonic, Silverado, Colorado, as well as new crate engines and a new, er, crate transmission.
The crate engines start with the LT376/535. This new crate engine is based on the production LT1 V-8 engine from the Corvette Stingray and Camaro SS. It gets a unique high-performance camshaft and CNC-ported cylinder heads. As a result, it puts out 535 naturally aspirated horsepower at 6,300 rpm and 470 pound-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm. That's 80 more horses than in the Camaro SS. This engine can be yours for $13,750.

Next up is the SP350/357. This carbureted V-8 takes the popular 350 H.O. crate engine to a new level, adding a hydraulic roller camshaft, the latest Small Block intake manifold design, and high-flow Vortec cylinder heads. As a result it puts out 357 hp and 407 lb-ft of torque. The cost is $7,250 in its turn-key configuration.
Chevrolet's 455-hp LT1 6.2L crate engine is now available in Connect & Cruise and E-ROD packages. With the Connect & Cruise package, the LT1 comes with a wet sump and the new 8L90-E 8-speed automatic transmission. The Connect & Cruise E-ROD system adds catalytic converters and other emissions components to make it CARB-compliant for 1996 and earlier vehicles in California.
That 8L90-E 8-speed automatic transmission is also now offered ready to use on LT1 and LT4 crate engines. It fits in the same space as GM’s family of 6-speed automatics. The price is $5,000 for the LT1 and $5,210 for the LT4.
Chevrolet was keen to point out that its line of Chevrolet Performance Parts are engineered, tested, and designed by the same engineers that created the cars for which they are intended. These parts are also backed by Chevrolet, and they don't void the manufacturer's warranty. Here is a list of what was unveiled at SEMA:
