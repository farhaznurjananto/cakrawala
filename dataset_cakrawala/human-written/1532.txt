Salesforce is one of the leading CRM company and hence the skill set is in demand. As per estimates Salesforce Economy to Create 3.3 Million New Jobs by 2022.

I have personally seen the growth in number of people going for Salesforce certification. The most sought after certificate is Admin. Thought there are tons of resources on how to get Salesforce certification very few nowadays talk about the coupon or discount code. Most of the Salesforce certification costs around $200 and some even $400 , it is not a small amount for many but a good investment for your career.

Free Salesforce Certification ?

It doesn’t exist anymore. Yes, few years back Salesforce used to do a lot of events where at the end of an event one will earn a voucher to get certified. Now there is only one way , few Salesforce community chapters organize meetups and give voucher to one or very few participants. So there is a chance to get lucky. Join and keep looking out for such events.

Another instance when Salesforce offers free certification is when they come up with a new Certificate. It is generally rare and you have to be a PRO in that area to clear it in one of the first timers.
