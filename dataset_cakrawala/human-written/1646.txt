A resident of Arlington's Madison Manor community found an unwanted visitor this weekend in their bathroom — a rat had come up through the sewer and was in the toilet.

The rodent intrusion occurred at about 11 a.m. Saturday in the 1200 block of North Powhatan Street, according to Arlington County Animal Control reports released this week.

"Evidently, they tried to flush it a couple of times. But I guess he or she wasn't having it. They can fight the current," Animal Control Chief Alice Burton told Patch.

Animal control officers responded and trapped and removed the rat.

Burton said such cases are infrequent but do occur.

"We don't get calls that often for it — maybe two to three a year," she said. "But that's when we get calls for them. People may be taking care of it themselves, or calling a pest company."

Burton said she's been with Arlington for about 12 years and only remembers one case where someone was bitten — on a holiday about a decade ago, and the person's reaction time was perhaps impaired.

Arlington County asks residents who find a rat in their toilet to call either animal control (703-931-9241) or a private pest company to remove the creature.

Residents are asked to then follow-up with the Arlington County Public Health Division's environmental health program at 703-228-7400. The county will assess the situation and try to determine if the intrusion is part of a larger infestation.
