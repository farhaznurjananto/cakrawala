Ford's new race car based on the upcoming GT supercar is currently testing on multiple continents ahead of a competition debut in 2016. We now know when that debut will happen as the Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] has posted up the car’s complete schedule for the 2016 motorsport season.
As previously announced, the new GT will be entered in both the United SportsCar Championship as well as the World Endurance Championship, with the latter containing the all-important 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The car’s first race, though, will be the 2016 Rolex 24 at Daytona, scheduled for the last weekend of January.
