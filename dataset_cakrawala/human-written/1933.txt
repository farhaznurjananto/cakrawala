You will be amazed at how your baby responds to our black and white books

At Mesmerised we specialise in black and white books & gifts designed specifically for babies from newborn until 12 months of age. Why do babies like looking at black and white?

'Black and white contrasting pictures maximise visual stimulation and appear to encourage infant development in the early months'. – Jennifer Gregor, Paediatric doctor, Melbourne, Australia.

A word from some happy Mums…

'Just wanted to say that my 5 month old baby LOVES Mesmerised and has done since she was only a month old. We just did a 10,000km car trip with her and Mesmerised saved the day. Thanks.' Susie, Kununurra, WA.

'Just had to say how beautiful your book is. A midwife at the mother and baby unit recommended it to us. I then recommended it to my online mums group. So many of the girls have raved since purchasing the book and flash cards!' Lisa, Hobart
