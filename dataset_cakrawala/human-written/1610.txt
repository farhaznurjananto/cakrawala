Addiction is hard

In the midst of my addiction, it felt like I was taking the easy path by continuing to drink.

In retrospect, I can see that my heavy drinking was making every aspect of my life more difficult than it needed to be.

Drinking was ruining my finances. Day by day, it seemed like I was only spending a few dollars on alcohol. Month by month, those few dollars added up to hundreds. Year by year, the hundreds became thousands.

It’s no exaggeration to say that over the course of my lifetime, I spent tens of thousands of dollars on booze. How much easier could those years have been if I hadn’t been putting that insane strain on my wallet?

Drinking was also getting in the way of my friendships and relationships. Alcohol is often called a “social lubricant,” but for me, it mostly got in the way. I couldn’t make real connections because I only learned how to talk to people when I had been drinking. I often avoided going out because I was embarrassed by my own drunkenness.

By the final years of my active addiction, alcohol had invaded every facet of my life. I was scheduling my time around drinking, and even when I was sober I could feel alcohol’s lingering effects in the form of hangovers and fatigue.

Perhaps worst of all: my addiction got harder and harder to live with as time went on.
