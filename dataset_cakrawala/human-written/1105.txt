One of the biggest challenges of leadership is evaluating the return on investment (ROI) for your efforts. I am constantly looking for a way to evaluate my leadership effectiveness. How do you put metrics to something as subjective as “developing character and core competencies in your team”? Is there a tool to evaluate our ROI and, hopefully, better use our time in ways that count?

What if you are spending 80% of your time doing something that’s only giving you a nominal-at-best ROI?

What if there is something you LOVE doing, it gives you a huge return, but you’re only spending a few hours a month in that?

I’m a big fan of leadership tools and evaluation systems. One of my earliest posts was walking through what I call the JQA Leadership Evaluation.

Over the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with what I’m calling the Task Revision Evaluation.

The benefit of this tool is that it’s quick, simple, and as helpful as you allow it to be. There are a few disclaimers I’ll go over at the end, so don’t skip those. For now, here is a blank version of the layout, an explanation, and an example.

Yes, that’s my real handwriting. Yes, I’ll let you know what it actually says below the image.

A blank template of the Task Revision Evaluation

TASK — What is it that takes your time?

TIME — How much time does it take? This can be numeric or generic.

PASSION — On a scale of 1–10, how in line with your passions is this task? If you want to up this, don’t pick 7. I wrote a blog post on that, check it out for details.

RETURN — When you look at your job, is this a high, medium, low, or negative return item?

REVISION — In light of this, what are your next steps? Do you need to give it more time? Do you need to change your approach? Do you need to delegate it? Do you need to put some false limits on how much time you spend with it? What are the revisions to your schedule, rhythm, job, or expectations that need to be made to better use your time?
