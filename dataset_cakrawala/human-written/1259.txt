I quarantined alone in New York City for two months. I forgot what grass looked like. Green? Kinda blade-like?

There were weeks when I barely saw the outdoors, just gazing through my foggy window on the brownstone-lined street. I stared at a computer all day for work and then stared at it some more as I watched movies or video chatted with friends.

Information overload reigned over my brain— too many things to get done, too many people messaging, and too little time. It seemed like nothing helped until I walked outside and felt the fresh air and warm sun.

Taking a walk is a proven way to clear your brain and feel energized about your day. When you feel stuck on a problem — like caught in writer’s block or unsure about a decision to make — go for a walk. It seems simple, but often the simplest solution is the best solution.

One small step for you, one giant step for your brain.

Go for a walk.
