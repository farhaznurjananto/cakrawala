San Antonio FC will hold open tryouts for prospective players on Saturday, Dec. 17 and Friday, Jan. 27 at STAR Soccer Complex, the club announced today. Players will have a chance to showcase their talent in front of SAFC Head Coach Darren Powell and the rest of the technical staff.

The first session on both dates will start at 8 a.m. and further time slots will be filled based off the number of player entries. Cost for entry is $125 and includes a training top and refreshments during the session. Individuals can sign up for San Antonio FC open tryouts, by visiting SanAntonioFC.com.

“We are excited to host our open tryouts,” said Powell. “We want to create a pathway for potential payers at San Antonio FC and we encourage players, that we may have not seen through our travels or scouting network, to come out so we can get a good look at them in December or January.”

Following the conclusion of tryouts, select players will be asked to attend an invite-only combine, which will be established at a later date.

San Antonio FC is currently prepping for its second season in the USL, which is scheduled to kick off in the spring. Fans interested in season tickets can contact the SAFC sales office at 210-444-5MLS or visit SanAntonioFC.com
