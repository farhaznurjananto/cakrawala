Do you want free time?

Don’t begin a business if you want more free time. That’s right. If you launch a business, you believe, oh, now I can resign from my job, the nine to five days a week, now I’m gonna be an entrepreneur, I’m gonna be an enterprise owner, that currently I’m gonna have freedom. You are hoping. You might retain freedom after struggling so many years, maybe a decade, then you will have some freedom.

The first five, ten years, you ain’t getting shit, okay. First of all, you are getting paid last. You give money to everybody else before you pay yourself. So if you believe you’re gonna get wealthy fast doing this, no. When you’re operating your own business, there’s no nine to five.

If you are a business holder or an entrepreneur. And you approve of me, comment below. There’s no nine to five. It is on your sense 24/7. When you take time off, you’re not off.

You know what I’m discussing. You’re worrying about your business, how to get additional customers, your team, your workers, cash flow difficulties you have and you’re not gonna earn extra time ’cause in the introduction, if you don’t give birth to those specific skills, the knowledge curve is deep.

It seizes a few years just to bring up a sense, get a feeling, and try to discover what works in your business, to break the code, right, being productive. And from there to accumulate, there’s still a long journey. Skip the nine to five. Skip five days a week.

It’s seven days, 24/7. That’s the stamina of an entrepreneur. And if you don’t like it and if that’s not in your blood and you want it so horrible, you’re not gonna accomplish what it assumes, you’re not gonna make those casualties ’cause it’s too damn difficult.
