I stood at the foot of a tall wooden ladder

piercing a purple cloud in the green heavens;

all around the ground was bare except for torn

pages from books, conical piles of ash, picnic

baskets, used condoms and pyramids of people’s

clothes. Two crickets were in conference on a naked

branch; a gigantic beaver romped along a dry

river-bed; while a toad took snuff from a thimble.

Red sheets of flame rose up, coming closer and yellow

with age. It frightened me. Lightning cracked the sky

and peeled the green to fall in flakes. A tidal wave

hesitated, but remained poised with lazy composure.

I trembled. Words filled the air to be swept away by

the wind that turned nasty, smelled of disinfectant

and had a walrus moustache. There were hands beckoning

from everywhere, not monotonous, but of different

shades; many were not hostile. A great visionary white

bird consumed quantities of snakes. I wanted to climb —

up and higher into the purple cloud. Voices threatened

to put the sun in a box forever. I struggled to climb

because of the multitude of sinners washed up on shore

decomposing. Lepers converged on me in a phalanx with

bells. I was crying. But my big toes were nailed to

the ground on that day that the bronze Buddha

came to life and ran away.
