Life in the Jungle: Building an Amazonian Medicine Center

I have been coming to Iquitos from the US since the winter of 2017. I have met many wonderful people here who treat me like family. This year I am living in the jungle at our sanctuary in order to build our dream of Earthlight Center.

I was in town on the Boulevard talking with a friend about getting a dog for companionship and security. She said, “That’s easy, look around at all the dogs on the Boulevard and pick one.” The dogs here roam like any other creature in nature. I saw two big & young dogs out of the 7 there, but I was not ready to “take” them.

A few weeks later my friend told me that she and her girlfriend were moving and asked me to adopt their 10-month old male mixed-breed dog named Balu. I could live with him to the jungle where he could run free and receive my love.

I looked at the pictures she showed me. Balu is tiny! I thought a big dog would give better security. Still, I have always had dogs in my life and most of them were small and I agreed to adopt Balu.

A couple weeks before getting Balu he was attacked. The beast ate half of Balu’s right ear…actually swallowing it! Balu is a true jungle dog with a big heart full of love and excitement for life. Losing an ear was no loss of love. What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. Right?

I could not have asked for a better watchdog. He’s potty-trained, loving, with soft & short hair to pet. If anyone or animal comes around Balu will be sure to tell me!

I love Balu a lot! Many thanks to my friends who I now call family. They will come visit Balu and he will go with me to town to visit them.
