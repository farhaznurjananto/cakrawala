👯‍♀ Lesson #1: VC is definitely an apprenticeship business and new VCs need to be like a sponge 🧽

I’m convinced that the most efficient way to learn how to become a VC is by receiving guidance from someone who is more experienced, who deeply understands the mechanisms, and who is willing to accompany you on your journey. If you think about it, it’s very much like mentoring. You (the mentee) need to acquire a specific skill set in a short period of time such as sourcing deals effectively, spotting great opportunities according to your investment thesis, negotiating terms, closing deals, managing relationships with founders/other VCs, among others. Trust me, these are skills which cannot be learned independently via books/podcasts/articles/etc — they need to be transferred by a more experienced person (the mentor). In my case, I work directly with two Partners — Alex & Ben — and therefore am fortunate to be able to learn directly from them, which is priceless. Let me explain: this structure gives me direct daily access to two mentors with different backgrounds and styles who constantly share insights, knowledge and advice. I’m seated in the front row and get to witness their thought processes from A-Z every single time we see a new opportunity, close a new deal or come across a new challenge. On top of that, these are the three best pieces of advice they have given me to hit the ground running:

(1) Don’t trust the hype. It’s easy to get FOMO on a “hot deal” and follow social signals but that only triggers irrational thinking and it clouds your judgment. Trust your gut feeling before anything else.

(2) Build your own network ASAP among key players in the ecosystem, including other funds. Be transparent and don’t be afraid to give more than you receive.

(3) Find and leverage your superpower. In my case I’d like to think it is marketing. So I have been empowered to create content around EdTech marketing (a series of EdTech marketing guides with leading CMOs + a global EdTech marketing report) and spend time with the CMOs of our companies in order to be as helpful as possible.

Takeaways: Find more experienced VCs (including at others funds) who are willing to provide guidance, support and encouragement during your journey. Absorb their knowledge and constantly assume that you are the least knowledgeable person in the room (…and you probably are 😉). Focus on your strengths and real domain of expertise to stand out and be authentic.
