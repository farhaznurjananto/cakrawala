for this entry, i wear no mask of poetry to hide how i feel. this would be more like a journal entry, and i suppose this will suffice as its resting place. all i can think of is the easiest way to end my pain, and that would be firing a twelve gauge shotgun round into my mouth straight to my brain whilst hanging by my feet atop a well. i’ve everything i need, i now just need to make the journey. i am currently seriously considering this option, as i feel i deserve it, and i wish to rid myself of this pain. i don’t wish for vices to escape the pain, i don’t wish for substances to numb myself, i don’t wish for sleep to enter my own world that’s a dice roll of chance whether it’s good, bad, or nonexistent, none of those will suffice. the pain with which i’m afflicted feels as though it can only be drowned out in blood, another way my mind is yelling at me is digging a hunting knife deep into both of my wrists facing the blade vertical and carving up to my elbow, or as far as i can get with a knife scraping up against my bone, opening up my arteries and veins like wet paper. these, i feel, are my only two options to rid myself of this pain, and all others, therefore ridding all others around me of the pains i cause them day in and day out. i feel this to be the superior option, and i do not fear death. however, i wish i would’ve gotten to accomplish more. this isn’t to say i’ll go through with this, honestly i don’t think i will, but it means i’ll be heavily considering this for some time, meaning the next thing to set me off could topple the pile and very well push me over the edge. this is not a cry for help, nor is it meant to scare anyone or evoke pity, this is merely a vice for me to speak my mind, as i have nobody to talk to. good morrow to all, may the end of the world join us soon.
