We just got this brutal video from an eXiled reader in Spain (HT: Àngel): Spanish riot police savagely attacking anti-austerity protesters in Madrid, without any apparent provocation. So far, the number of injured is at least 76 and growing, according to Àngel. The protests were fueled by today’s announcement of the largest austerity cuts in Spain since the days of fascist dictator General Franco—meaning the bankers are going in for the kill in Spain, despite false PR reports of bankers easing up on their demands.

Here is what class warfare looks like today in Spain:

The protests, led by the miners who marched 450 kilometers over the past 2-1/2 weeks to reach Madrid, come as Spain announced another $80 billion in budget cuts to keep the bankers fed, as well as huge cuts in the mining sector that will mean thousands more layoffs.

Here is another photo of a young Spanish woman brutally beaten by the banksters’ Austerity Gestapo. Her crime: exercising her right to protest against banker enslavement.
