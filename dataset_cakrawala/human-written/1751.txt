Make sense of your storyline from the past 12 months and reflect on what script you would like to experience in the year ahead.

I’ve been thinking about the “old days” before Netflix and binge-watching, to the era when the quality of TV began to equal, or surpass in many instances, that of films. Although I personally never watched them, shows like Lost, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men and Game of Thrones were national obsessions for a minute, as there were fewer home media options and outlets only a decade ago. Ahhh … such a time of simplicity and unity!

In this new world of lockdowns and quarantines, we have become an even more captive audience for numerous formats of entertainment being broadcast to us, mostly on demand, in a variety of ways. And then there are the real-life soap operas and dramas going on in our country — which via the news media’s crafted narratives and framing make it increasingly harder to believe what is fact and what is fiction, with the truth generally lying somewhere in between. This means that, more than ever, the onus is on each of us to discern for ourselves what we can from those vying to control our minds, bodies and bank accounts. But that is a topic for another day… .

Since we are approaching the end of a year that no one would have believed if they read it in a script a year ago, it’s important to see what part you have played in 2020: What were your plot twists and character development? What do you want next season to look like, or is it a series finale for you in a relationship, job or living situation, or in your persona? What new character would you like to play or story would you like to write in 2021 and beyond?

We all need an escape now and then, and movies and TV shows can be a very big and enjoyable part of that, but how much time are you investing in a fictional world rather than in your own?
