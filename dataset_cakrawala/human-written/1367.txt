Air stings of emptying cloud

a gust of drops in myriad keys,

crystal energy flecks window

melting in opaque night.

I warm like flexing shield,

like stellar waters

drinking traces of heat,

a filament tapping pane

in equilibrium of self,

my fireside soul within.

I have wrung the weight

to do anything else

but collect little fire and

dream in patter and spark.
