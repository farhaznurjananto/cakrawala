‘No one has ever become poor by giving’, says Anne Frank

Sunday Poetry

Giving creates a way for abundance

The Universe creates attendance

Your giving lifts others up

That's the overflow of your cup

Giving, therefore, is a privilege

Do not commit a sacrilege

By not raising others up

And forfeit your blessings

Therefore give cheerfully

To those God sends your way

A kind gesture to reach the wound

Of that broken heart.

Created from the quote: ‘’Not for ourselves alone, we are born’’
