Our Blombos Cave

There’s a hollow bone echo

carving its way

into the fabric of my being

a baseline isomorphism

Boom ba boom ba dada da…

Swaying mystery without an edge

and yet there it was all along

in our paintings and songs

blazing stars of the primary fire,

drawn in the blood of the first hunt

Within my bellowing soul,

I am but a beast

with hindsight and epiphanies

yet the galaxies don’t seem to stay put

and the seashore is filled

with skulls brought in by the tide

Do I run or do I hide?

In the chambers of the neocortex

for fortitude reaching forth

the fall entangled always with pride

and yet, how do I decide?

To rise from my tattered casket

and cry out my whiskey prophecies

finally, unleashed to the realms of man?

Yet was this always the plan?

Was I as delicate as that octopus

that watched us fall apart

collecting that final

gold timepiece in its den.

And I wonder,

is there even a moment left to pass,

when disorder is maximized at last.

Have we grown tired of the flame?

The remnants of a mortician’s

weathered hands, as the reaper naps nearby

have we forgotten the face on the moon?

It was always a grin,

a revolting wild howl,

as tragedy played itself out,

on a stage that never stopped

and a playwright that went mad.

Yet how do we decide to live,

among the dead, to love

each other among the vile,

to find wholeness among the fractured

and peace amongst depravity?

Will we ever start again?

I wonder,

listening to the drumbeat of sorrow

break

the chords to chance and fate.

Boom ba boom ba …

dada da…

Boom ba.
