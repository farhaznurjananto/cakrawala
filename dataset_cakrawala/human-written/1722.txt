1. Dropshipping

Dropshipping is an order fulfillment method that does not require a business to keep products in stock. Instead, the store sells the product, and passes on the sales order to a third-party supplier, who then ships the order to the customer. This is great for people who are looking for low-cost startups, as dropshipping is among some of the easiest to start with. To make matters even easier, you do not even have to own the products to start earning from them! The only things you need to start drop shipping is a platform like shopify to build your store, and salehoo to get your products.

2. Stock Trading

Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an attempt to time the market. The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day. This grants people the perfect opportunity to truly scale their income, as certain stocks tend to be very volatile. On the flip side, if you lack experience in the stock market it is just as easy to lose great amounts of income without proper training. Here are 10 steps to profitable trading to help you gain an edge in the market as a beginner.

3. Photography

Photography is a good career if you have an excellent skill set, good creative ability, composition, and technical expertise. The photography career can be challenging and it may give you a hard time if you are not passionate about it. Good photography skills come with a lot of practice and hard work. While the equipment can be expensive, these days cell phone cameras have become extremely ideal for casual and beginner levels of photography.

4. Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. Similar to dropshipping, affiliate marketing is very easy to get into, because it does not require much capital to star seeing results. The biggest difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping is simply that with affiliate marketing, you are not selling the product, you are just referring potential buyers to another company’s product for a commision.
