The current state of precautions as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the globe, is seeing a mass cancelling of events, gigs and other physical interactions due to safety measures. While we need to ensure everyone stays safe and prevents the spread of the virus any further, the repercussions on our creative community have been huge.

Live performances, gigs, meetups, festivals, workshops, local businesses, creative freelancers and other gig workers have been affected by these cancellations, which calls for a solution and a group effort to band together and #SupportLocalProjects

We want to highlight some clear ways in which you can access support for your own creative output, an artist or organisation that is doing it tough, or simply show your appreciation to this community during this time. Share the message with all those who need to hear it: we all can lean on each other and bring our elbows together in solidarity!

Support Local Artists via Streaming, Buying Merch or Sharing their Music/Art with your friends!

Check out your favourite local artists’ website to see if you can support them by buying a record or a t-shirt. Bandcamp is a great platform for artists to sell their music and merch online, and for fans to support them without buying a ticket to a show. They recently gave 100% of all proceeds back to artists for 24hrs but even with their regular fee, the artist will receive up to 85% of the purchase.

Run a Crowdfunding Campaign via Pozible!

We are always here to help creatives in setting up and getting the most out of a campaign to raise funds for a specific project or idea. Now is the time for artists to get creative and use their networks to raise funds. Is it just me, or is anyone else keen to hear what amazing albums/EPs/livestreams can come from #socialdistancing and not playing live gigs?!

Check out this newly-created website where you can register your gig or event that was cancelled and add it to the list of over 250k (and counting) live events that cannot go ahead. Plenty of resources for music industry and hospitality workers too!

This topic is one that will no doubt develop and become more normal as this situation unfolds. Currently, we are unsure as to how long the ban on live events will go on for so for artists looking to stream performances or offer fans a way of engaging with them, this is the next best thing.
