First, we create media that teaches rhetorical skills to our audience in hope that doing so will make an impact on the conversations we have around the news.

We believe that the best way to make sense of all of the stories is to talk about them calmly and constructively, listening and responding with empathy.

Second, our news aggregator platform (currently in development) will be designed for our consumers to become exposed to various angles of the news, much like a food court for news. We also will encourage thoughtful discussion between publishers and their audience, creating an engaged news cycle where the audience gets to participate and have a say about what news is covered.

We also will host a moderated discussion environment in our platform for people to constructively debate about current events so everyone stays informed and our ideas are challenged.

Finally, we host events to catch our audience up on the headlines and to see eye to eye with one another. Itâ€™s our belief that creating authentic in-person experiences where critical topics are discussed is the best way for us to build understanding and empathy around complicated current events.

One of our recurring events are called Coffee Convos, which gathers a small group of people at a coffee shop to talk about local and national headlines in a moderated environment.
