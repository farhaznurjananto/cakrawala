While not bashing his head against the desk repeatedly at work or sitting in conference calls pretending to be clever, he writes blog posts, occasionally trudges around town in running shoes, and attempts to survive living in a house with four women, two cats, and a number of fish.

He lives in deepest darkest England â€” land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts, and silent indignation. He grew up near Oxford, and has ended up living in the countryside just outside London.

He likes anything easy to cook, wine, chocolate biscuits, tea, coffee, movies, music, and cycling. He is as colour-blind as a hedgehog in a bag, but can draw a mean doodle. He listens to random music on Spotify, watches streaming TV shows on the internet, and spends far too much time playing retro video games.

He writes at Medium about all sorts of things.
