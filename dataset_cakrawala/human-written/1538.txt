LinkedIn tips for writing viral articles

If you are going to write something, you want your content to be discovered and read by as many people as possible. Right?

People are bombarded with more content than they could ever read. Most people are both incredibly busy and have the attention span of a goldfish.

Influencers on LinkedIn Pulse like my man Richard Branson, have over 13 million followers. But you‚Äôre not Richard so how do you make your content go further and get people reading?

According to LinkedIn‚Äôs latest available figures, more than a million people have published posts on LinkedIn‚Äôs platform; more than 130,000 posts are published every week; and the average post reaches LinkedIn members in 21 industries and nine countries.

After all, there are now over 500M members on LinkedIn.

Hack #1 ‚Äî Grow Your LinkedIn Connections

Every time you publish a post on LinkedIn, your connections will see an alert in their notifications. But to really make ripples, you need a large audience of first-level connections.

For any of the stuff we‚Äôre talking about throughout this post to really work, you‚Äôll need to make as many connections as you possibly can that may be interested in your content.

Hack #2 ‚Äî Get Featured on Channels

LinkedIn Pulse has more than 100 individual channels. Some of the most popular channels are for Leadership & Management, Big Ideas & Innovation, Technology, Entrepreneurship, and Social Media.

Want to get a story featured on LinkedIn Pulse? Then you‚Äôll have to tweet at them.

Ask a Pulse editor to share your story on the channel on Twitter with ‚ÄúTip @LinkedInEditors #LinkedInPulse‚Äù at the end of your tweet.

Yes, seriously, use Twitter to get featured on Linked :) LOL üò±

Hack #3 ‚Äî Good ol‚Äô SEO

To categorise your content, LinkedIn Pulse does an analysis of the text of your article.

This is like SEO tactics of the dark ages, when all you had to do was include your keyword in the title and use the right words a few times throughout the post.

LinkedIn is still a relatively easy search engine to manipulate.

But a word of caution. This will evolve just like Google did, so my advice is always act with integrity online.

Let me be clear, keyword stuffing is a bad idea (even though right now, it will probably get you a lot of exposure).

Hack #4 ‚Äî Non-Boring Images

Definitely avoid using boring images in your content, such as:

Generic headshots.

Company logos.

Blurry photos, small pics, anything that will make you squint

Stock photos

How you chose images will come down to your brand. But get creative and save the images using keywords ‚Äî that will help with your SEO!

You can see that I use eye-catching images in my article banners to capture attention and stand-out from the crowd. I‚Äôll share the link below in the comments section so you can see the banners for all of my articles.

That‚Äôs it!

Good luck.
