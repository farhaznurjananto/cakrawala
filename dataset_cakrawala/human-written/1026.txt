What do we all like to do on the New Year’s Eve? Of course to plan our future and also to sum up the results of the previous year. Following the tradition, we would like to share with you what was the year 2017 like for HashCoins and its major projects — HashFlare and Polybius. Perhaps a glimpse into the past will tell what to expect from 2018.And now we pass the word to the representatives of the projects!2017 was vibrant. The wave of interest towards cryptocurrencies and mining has risen unexpectedly and has washed out everything on its path — only the most persistent could withstand. Fortunately, HashFlare is one of those projects that managed to cope with exponentially growing interest towards cryptocurrencies.Yes, despite some difficulties we’ve faced (could it be otherwise?), 2017 was successful:Without any exaggerations the last quarter of 2017 was really mind-blowing for the cryptocurrency world — everything and everyone were blown away, as well as our processing services — the network stood still, and transactions didn’t go through. All these problems are related to the immaturity of cryptocurrencies, but in fact, this is a temporary phenomenon. Next year we look forward to functional upgrade not only of our services but the whole Bitcoin network. That means everything is going to be much faster, more stable, more reliable and more convenient than it is now.We’ve talked a lot about the preparatory work that was carried out this year, and finally, we are ready to answer the question bothering thousands of Polybius token holders — “What is going on? Is anything happening at all?”In early 2017 the Polybius project was fully compiled, and its idea seemed to be tempting not only to us but also to the general public — for implementation of the project we were able to conduct a very successful ICO — it was among the most successful ones by the standards of summer 2017.What have we done since then?Finally, we compile and describe company’s development trajectory (so-called roadmap) — this is the plan for our further development which we also are going to share with you in early 2018.Behind all of the preparatory work is a huge amount of paper chase, without which, however, it is impossible to start any project. At the moment we have prepared and sent documents to a considerable amount of companies that will be engaged in servicing or working with us. It is referred to the developers who will work on the DigitalPass and the infrastructure of the project, as well as agencies that will prepare documents and a legal base needed to appeal for a license. Finally, we are working through our legal agreements and have already signed contracts with the key partners who will provide us financial and business consulting services.The main thing we are aiming right now is cooperation with the auditor who by the summer of 2018 will have to check company’s financial statements for the current year. Among other things, the auditor will recalculate funds and check the wallets to make sure we have reflected all the data correctly. Our accountants are already preparing for this time-consuming process.Thus at the time, almost all preparatory work has been done. The implementation of our plans will begin in 2018. Next December we are looking forward to being able not only to please you with recaps or prototypes but with an entirely operational product.___________________________________________________________________Summing up helps to assess own strengths and capabilities and still think about prospects and plans for 2018. Next year we are going to introduce you some exciting and useful blockchain products. And, of course, we will continue working on our existing projects. Stay tuned!Happy New Year!HashCoins team.
