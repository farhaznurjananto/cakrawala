EdTech is about using technology to aid learning.

Thanks captain obvious. Tell me more:

Okay, remember the days of back-breaking textbooks and spitballs? No more of that. Kids in these days can have an entire curricula on a computer and smart devices (and are able to make high powered catapults for all out spitball wars).

Single spitballs are so 1978.

The idea of Educational Technology has floated around since we started using computers to enhance learning in the eighties; but today, ‘Modern Electronic Educational Technology’ encompasses much more.

If you look below, you can see the evolution of EdTech.

A nugget of history from WebAnywhere.co.uk

From m-learning (using mobile devices to learn) to virtual education (where the students and teachers use technology to connect) EdTech is more than just the implementation of computers in school.

The study of media psychology delves deeper into ‘what defines’ EdTech, but we’ll leave the philosophy to the philosophers.

All you need to know is that this hot topic of EdTech is an ever-evolving concept, where cell phones, virtual reality, computers, and other technological devices enhance education.
