Hello there! I am Filipa. I live in London and have started working as a professional organiser & declutterer for a couple of years. Thanks to Marie Kondo, I don’t need to explain what that is anymore. I’m happy that all the benefits that come with #decluttering are starting to be acknowledged. And that really sparks joy!

My experience tells me that the hardest part of the process for my clients (and me!) is when they finish decluttering a room and look at that huge pile of unwanted items. I actually believe that people don’t even start decluttering because they fear so much about that pile at the end.

At this point, another issue comes up. The environmental impact our stuff has. Not just when we buy it, but also when we are getting rid of it. Disposing responsibly of our unwanted items is as important as consuming less, buying local and becoming more aware of where things come from.

These are the 2 main reasons that led me to start Space Sorted. The aim is to help you find ways to sort your space out but in an ethical and responsible manner.

#SpaceSorted is all about creating a more sustainable home. We talk #recycling, #donating, #upcycling, #DIY, #sustainable businesses in London (mostly #Islington and #Hackney which is where I wander). All that kind of cool stuff… and essentially sharing easy strategies for busy city people like us to be that little bit less crappy. No big deal.

It would be awesome to follow your journey too. There will plenty of opportunities for that at the #7DaysOfSpace challenge that might change your life. Join by tweeting, sharing posts on Facebook or pictures on Instagram. Just include #7DaysOfSpace, so I know you’re out there making the world a better place.

Follow my little steps here or on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, depending on where you hang out the most.
