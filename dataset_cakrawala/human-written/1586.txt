This recipe started with one from Helen Rennie, who is one of my favorite food youtubers. But I changed it a lot.

Serves one very hungry person or two more normal appetites as a main course.

Ingredients

(all amounts approximate)

6 ounces bacon OR 6 ounces duck bacon and 2 Tbsps. olive oil (I get duck bacon from a farmer’s market near me. It’s delicious and much less fatty that the usual bacon)

1 head cabbage, core removed, sliced into strips about 1/4" wide

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp red pepper flakes

1/2 tsp caraway seeds

4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled

juice of 1 lemon
