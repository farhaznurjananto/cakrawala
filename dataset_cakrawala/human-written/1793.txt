All of the Linear Algebra Operations that You Need to Use
in NumPy for Machine Learning.
The Python numerical computation library called NumPy provides many linear algebra functions that may be useful as a machine learning practitioner.
In this tutorial, you will discover the key functions for working with vectors and matrices that you may find useful as a machine learning practitioner.
This is a cheat sheet and all examples are short and assume you are familiar with the operation being performed.
You may want to bookmark this page for future reference.
Kick-start your project with my new book Linear Algebra for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
Let’s get started.

1. Arrays
There are many ways to create NumPy arrays.
Array
1
2
from numpy import array
A = array([[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]])
Empty

from numpy import empty
A = empty([3,3])
Zeros
1
2
from numpy import zeros
A = zeros([3,5])
Ones
1
2
from numpy import ones
A = ones([5, 5])
2. Vectors
A vector is a list or column of scalars.
Vector Addition
1
c = a + b
Vector Subtraction
1
c = a - b
Vector Multiplication
1
c = a * b
Vector Division
1
c = a / b
Vector Dot Product
1
2
c = a.dot(b)
c = a @ b
Vector-Scalar Multiplication
1
c = a * 2.2
Vector Norm
1
2
from numpy.linalg import norm
l2 = norm(v)
3. Matrices
A matrix is a two-dimensional array of scalars.
Matrix Addition
1
C = A + B
Matrix Subtraction
1
C = A - B
Matrix Multiplication (Hadamard Product)
1
C = A * B
Matrix Division
1
C = A / B
Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product)
1
2
C = A.dot(B)
C = A @ B
Matrix-Vector Multiplication (Dot Product)
1
2
C = A.dot(b)
C = A @ b
Matrix-Scalar Multiplication
1
2
C = A.dot(2.2)
C = A * 2.2
4. Types of Matrices
Different types of matrices are often used as elements in broader calculations.
Triangle Matrix
1
2
3
4
5
6
# lower
from numpy import tril
lower = tril(M)
# upper
from numpy import triu
upper = triu(M)

2
from numpy.linalg import matrix_rank
r = matrix_rank(A)
6. Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization, or matrix decomposition, breaks a matrix down into its constituent parts to make other operations simpler and more numerically stable.
LU Decomposition
