Last weekend, the Shopee Designers bonded over an intensive session of rhythm cycling—or more familiarly known as spinning to some—at Absolute Cycle Singapore. The activity was split into 2 sessions of about 20 riders, in accordance with current social distancing measures.

With the myriad of virtual meetings this year, physical activity was precisely the remedy we needed to combat “Zoom fatigue”. Additionally, a good sweat can also heighten mental focus and clarity, thus making spinning the perfect activity to kick designer blocks in the butt while moving to the beats of great music.

The hour-long session consisted of a 15-minute bike setup and safety briefing, and subsequently, a 45-minute intensive ride. Upon entering the studio, we were greeted by psychedelic surrounding lights that resembled the atmosphere of a sophisticated night club, and carefully curated music meant to send our energy levels through the roof. As our instructor’s energy skyrockets, coupled with some highly challenging choreography on the bikes (hello, legs!), we found ourselves in a little dancing, headbanging situation.
