Strain review

Gorilla Glue #4 “A great time to be stuck”

20:1

Rewind two days earlier I’m peeling myself from the couch after a much anticipated 4/20 celebration with one of my sticky favorites. “Gorilla glue” a,k.a “Gg4”or “Original Glue”. Bright green buds coated in a white blanket of resin cuddled by orange hairs gives a pungent earthy smell accompanied by a peppery scent and lemony aroma as I place the dense brittle bud between my grinders teeth. Fast forward to A modest taste of citrus and herbs bathing over me as I inhale the smooth. A strong profile of Myrene, Limonene, and Caryophyllene are present with each inhale.Veteran cannabis consumers would be proud to include this onto their flavor pallet as it not only offers a bold flavor, but also potent psychological and physical effects with a 20:1 THC to CBD ratio. First arriving with a heavy buzz this strand keeps the consumer focused and relaxed before lulling them to a sound sleep. Also aiding to lull depression, stress and anxiety this indica dominant hybrid makes for the perfect creatives aid. Or the perfect “Glue” to keep you relaxed on the couch all day.
