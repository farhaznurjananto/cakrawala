Google Sheets CRYPTOBALANCE Formula

The CRYPTOBALANCE function returns wallet balances for over 150 cryptocurrencies. You will be able to access the balance through the following formula:

=CRYPTOBALANCE(“CRYPTOCURRENCY TICKER”,“PUBLIC WALLET ADDRESS”, EMPTY CELL REFERENCE)

NB : in some countries like Italy and Russia, Google sheet’s formula syntax is done with semicolon ‘ ; ’ instead of the comma ‘ , ’

If you get an error message from the formula, it might be the reason. In this case, the formula then becomes :

=CRYPTOBALANCE(“CRYPTOCURRENCY TICKER” ; “PUBLIC WALLET ADDRESS” ; EMPTY CELL REFERENCE)

2 Required Parameters + 1 Optional

{“CRYPTOCURRENCY TICKER”} The cryptocurrency TICKER/SYMBOL data to fetch, for example the symbol of Bitcoin is BTC. {“PUBLIC WALLET ADDRESS”} The wallet address associated with the cryptocurrency you want the balance from. Please pay attention, DO NOT ENTER your private wallet address. Optional {EMPTY CELL REFERENCE} ONLY on 3rd argument. Reference an empty cell and change its content to force refresh of the balances.

EXAMPLE

BINANCE BTC Cold Wallet Balance

=CRYPTOBALANCE(“BTC”,“34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo”, $A$1)
