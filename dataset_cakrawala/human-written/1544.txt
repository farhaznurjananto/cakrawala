Feeling down about the news? Do This.

Two years ago, Today Do This published its first ‘do-something-about-the-news letter’. It was an antidote to the barrage of negative headlines; a way to spotlight people doing good, and a tool to inspire more of us to follow their lead.

Every Friday since, we’ve picked a recent news story and shared one simple thing you can do that day to make a difference. Readers say it makes them feel less victim to the troubles of the world and more confident to create change. Which is exactly the change we want to create…

For too long, we’ve all been led to believe that we, as individuals, can’t do anything about the state of the world. We’re too small, too inexperienced, too ignorant of the situation, too lacking in talent or connections or influence. We don’t buy that.

Each and every one of us — through our actions, or inaction — bears some responsibility for making the world how it is. And it’s our small individual actions today that create big collective change tomorrow.

Over the past year, the link between individual action and collective change was particularly hard to miss. School kids affected government climate policy. Workers pressed companies take a stand on racial injustice. Voters challenged threats to democracy. And the choices we each made on whether to wash our hands and wear a mask influenced the ebbs and flows of a global pandemic.

It just goes to show, you can make real change. Yes, you. And so, today, we’re sharing the news stories and practical actions featured in our weekly newsletter over the past year. Because there’s more we can all do to build a freer, fairer, more sustainable world.
