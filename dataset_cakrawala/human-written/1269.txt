SERENE SUNDAYS!!!!

Ahhhhâ€¦.nothing like a relaxing Sunday. Iâ€™m sitting here enjoying a nice hot cup of ginger tea while relaxing and reflecting on the week and whatâ€™s to come.

Have you ever HAD to do whatâ€™s right even though deep down it broke your heart?! I know Iâ€™m not alone here ðŸ¤¨

Sometimes in life in order to take a step forward we have to take a big step back. A step back that makes you question everything youâ€™ve ever done and even though you know itâ€™s for the best it still hurts like hell.

Listen, itâ€™s ok to feel those emotions. Itâ€™s ok to cry. Throw shit. Be mad, happy, and sad all at the same time! Those are YOUR FEELINGS and you deserve to feel them.

BUT! We canâ€™t stay there yâ€™all. I know itâ€™s tempting to curl up into a ball and want to stay there forever, but we canâ€™t. You have a purpose in this world and it needs to hear your voice and see your smile.

Take some time to rest, recharge, and reset. Maybe itâ€™s time for you to take some RADICAL action. That thing thatâ€™s been burning in your belly for yearsâ€¦itâ€™s time to start working on it so you can turn your STEP BACK into your biggest STEP UP!

Do me a favor and share this article with a friend who needs to hear this today and rememberâ€¦..Iâ€™ve got your back ðŸ’‹
