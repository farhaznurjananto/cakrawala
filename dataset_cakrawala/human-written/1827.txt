I have always seen myself as a coward. Since I was a little kid, I always tried to prevent the things I didn’t like to do. The pattern was something like this;

I tried. But after several tries without any success, I would stop. I would determine it wasn’t something for me and I would simply give up.

Later in life, I gave myself the excuse that this behaviour was completely fine. This behaviour made sure we simply focus on our strengths instead of our weaknesses.

In hindsight, I now realise the consequences of this behaviour. I have not driven in a car (despite having a license) for 7 years straight, I can’t ice skate, I never dared to present for large groups or train my backhand swing.

To be honest, I also didn’t really need it. I still played on a semi-professional level, could use public transport and simply didn’t give any presentations.

I focused on the things I was good at and lived a comfortable life in the comfort zone. Life was pretty good.

So, why would I focus on tackling my fears? I realized last year, that I am not really scared of driving a car or ice skating. I am more scared of what others might think of me when I might fail. I was — like many others — afraid to be a beginner. Afraid to admit there are things I cannot do yet. Afraid to be ridiculed.

And this fear can have a huge negative effect on my life.

It is terrifying to try to overcome your fears. However, it is even more terrifying if you have to ask yourself at the end of your life “what if, what if I just dared to do it”.

That is why I decided to stop avoiding my long-hidden fears. This habit has to be stopped and replaced by one of showing courage.
