Voice actress Natsuko Kuwatani announced on her blog on Wednesday that she is taking time off from work to recover from a viral infection in her vocal cords. She explained that more time is needed for a complete recovery, so she is devoting herself to her ongoing treatment until then. As soon as she is back to normal, she will resume her blog again.

Kuwatani has been hosting the Yotteku~? radio program with Kana Ueda . However, Kaori Shimizu took Kuwatani's place as a "pinch hitter" during last week and this week's episodes.

Kuwatani was scheduled to reprise her role as Suiseiseki in the the new Rozen Maiden anime that will premiere in July. Her many other roles include Ai Mikami in The Future Diary and Ry≈çko Asakura in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya . She happened to replace Yuko Goto as F. Walsingham in Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere II when Goto was undergoing her own medical treatment for an autoimmune disease.
