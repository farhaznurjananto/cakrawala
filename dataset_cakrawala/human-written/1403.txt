It’s December 13, and the day is almost drawing to a close. Well not quite, it’s 12:00 pm but for the first time in 4 years I’m already over the day, and it has barely just begun.

I woke up knowing that the day will turn out like any other day. I had no grand expectations. Even with my track record of questionable birthdays, I still looked forward to them so I don’t know what happened this year. Maybe it’s the stress or frustration of 2020 in general, who knows?

What I do know is that I don’t have any feelings of happiness or even sadness. I don’t feel different or changed and that extra sparkle that comes with adding another year has become dull, replaced with nonchalance and lethargy.

If you had told me earlier in the year that this was how I would feel I would’ve laughed and told you that was impossible. Birthdays (along with any other holiday really) were my hype days. I had carried all my friend’s birthdays on my head so why was mine any different? Like I said earlier, I don’t know. My friends didn’t know either.

I don’t want this post to sound ungrateful because I am grateful for life, I definitely do not take that for granted but I would be lying if I said I was over the moon on the 13th of December.

Why I’m telling you this then? I don’t know. Maybe you do relate, maybe you don’t.

Thoughts aside, here’s to turning the page and starting a new chapter.

Chapter 20 please be good to me. Thanks.
