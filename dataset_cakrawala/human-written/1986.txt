Stories...

Stories:

Of long lost lovers

Of loving grand mothers

Of bunked classes

And broken glasses

A tormented chronicle of an honest cab driver

Of a maid's life being a rape survivor

Stories..

Stories help you bond and more

Let you witness new memories unfold

A glass of rum and events unfroze

All you seek, you unknowingly disclose

Stories....

Stories:

Of daredevil stunts that let you boast

Events that make you worry the most

Of times when you felt like bliss

The time you had your first ever kiss

Stories...

Stories weave and stories swell

Of your hidden turmoils, they secretly tell

Stories let you momentarily free

Beyond your masks they let you be

Stories..

You live the life you once hopefully dreamt

Knowing tomorrow shall be a Steep descent

From all you dreamt and all you hoped

Yet you let your dreams be provoked!

Because.. stories!!

Since a glass of rum is your exile

From your daily regime that you sustain with a smile

So you relish in the stories that you allow yourself spell

And the night dissolves in the chronicles you tellâ€¦
