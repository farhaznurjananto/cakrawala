Friday Notes #3 — Being a Full-time blogger. This week was the first in a series of three where I’m on vacation, at home. Instead of doing my writing early in the morning or at night before going to bed, I did it just like a typical daytime job, during the day. And I liked it a lot; It felt like coming out of clandestinity. It was liberating. Now the question is: what if blogging was my full-time job? Would I enjoy it more or less? Is this only a part-type thing where pauses are beneficial to my writing process? When I’m retired, maybe this could become a full-time thing where my writing experience as a long time writer will take the place of the helpful breaks. Meanwhile, I do enjoy doing it with more intensity – Merry Christmas to all my readers. Take care. Be safe.
