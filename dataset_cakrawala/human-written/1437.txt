The things I take from you

the things I took from them

space between letters

his rough edges

her creased eyes crazed and licking at us like wildfire

I stay close to the dark parts

the darkest parts of the ones I

never know I love until

the light has left us both.

The darkest parts reflect us clearly.

In the mirror I do not see myself

I see A self, a body belonging to me

but not mine.

How to be myself when I am not who I know myself to be?

Not the me I see in my dreams?

So easy to give away my body to

you and you and you

when it barely belongs to me.

These long limbs, soft parts, delicate thought.

The things I give to you,

how could you not ask for more and expect the same?
