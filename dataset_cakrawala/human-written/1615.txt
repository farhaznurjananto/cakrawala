Hyundai’s Genesis Coupe drops its four-cylinder engine for the 2015 model year, meaning the car now features a V-6 as standard across the range. This also means the starting price of the 2015 model is higher than last year, but to help offset the sticker shock the Korean automaker has introduced a new entry-level Base trim while also removing the Grand Touring trim.

The Base model equipped with a six-speed manual is priced from $27,645. Opt for the Genesis Coupe’s available eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters, and the Base model’s starting price rises to $28,845. The Genesis Coupe R-Spec sits in the middle of the range and comes exclusively with a manual transmission. Pricing for this model starts at $30,395.
The range-topper is the Genesis Coupe Ultimate, which starts at $34,295 for manual-equipped models and a staggering $35,495 when equipped with an automatic. All prices listed include Hyundai’s standard $895 destination charge.
No extra power is available, which means the car’s 3.8-liter V-6 engine is still rated at 348 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. Drive on all models goes to the rear wheels, with the R-Spec and Ultimate available with a Torsen limited-slip differential. Owners can expect 0-60 mph times in the low five-second bracket and top speed is electronically limited to 149 mph.

Sales of the 2015 Hyundai Genesis Coupe commence this fall.
Hyundai’s decision to drop the four-cylinder engine from the Genesis Coupe lineup allows the automaker to reposition the car with premium performance buyers, helping pave the way for a much more substantial successor. Currently expected to be launched for the 2017 model year, the next-generation Genesis Coupe will reportedly be larger and offer V-6 and V-8 engines.
