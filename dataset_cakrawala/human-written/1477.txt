Earlier today, the new LG G2 found its way into a handful of clear pictures, showing off a big, beautiful edge-to-edge display with on-screen navigation buttons. We also got a look at the phone’s unique Power and Volume button setup, which happens to be on the back of the device underneath the camera lens. Overall though, the set of pictures showed an impressive looking phone that even non-LG fans should get at least a little excited over. But if those photos weren’t enough, this 1-minute clip of the device in action should help.

Thanks to YouTube channel 4Leakz, we get a quick tour of the G2 that includes an unlock with the rear back button, navigation through screens, a look at the model number (Android 4.2.2 on board too), and interaction with those on-screen navigation keys, which appear to float thanks to their transparent background. It’s snappy, as one would expect with that Snapdragon 800 on board.

Come on, you have to be impressed, right?
