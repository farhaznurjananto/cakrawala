All you need to know about Pointers -Part-1

Working with addresses and Understanding Dynamic memory allocation

One of the most important concepts in C, is pointers. Moreover, this concept is considered to be most confusing and one of the most difficult to understand. I say, this is a misconception. It is not really that difficult to understand. This article will be really helpful and will make it really easy for you to understand!

So, Let us get started!

Dealing with Addresses and the need for Pointers

We have been using addresses implicitly during programming. This can be realized with a simple example.

In the above program, the variable a is a named location and is given a place in the memory (i.e., address).The value stored at that address is 10.

Now, we often get situations where we need to explicitly work with addresses. This is where we need to realize the need for pointers.
