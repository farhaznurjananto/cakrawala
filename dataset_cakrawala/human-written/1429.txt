Want Real Life, Real/igion?

Go ahead — one more newsletter won’t hurt you…

At least, this one won’t.

Look: I don’t believe that every random word I write is platinum.

But if you follow Real Life, Real/igion, you’ll get the word when there’s something holy enough to laugh about, human enough to rant about, or something else indescribable.

Because this is real/igion for the rest of us.

We are the congregation of the real world.
