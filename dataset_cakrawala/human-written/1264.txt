Agreed but with the caveat that they need to (A) proactively recruit BIPOC who are qualified (not just anyone who happens to check the Black box) and (B) actually intend to hire the best person for the job even if they happen to be Black or otherwise not a “culture fit" (because no qualified person wants to dance like a monkey for the sole purpose of the White Man’s entertainment).

Applying and nterviewing for no reason always makes me feel like a minstrel character in Bamboozeld, a Spike Lee joint (2000). Like you, Rebecca, I’m over it. I’d rather spend my time working on my memoirs. While I might be more likely to win the lottery than a getting any job I’m trained and qualified to do, I think the odds of a bestselling book are at least as good as (or greater than) equitably compensated employment in the next 3-5 years (or ever in my lifetime).

At this point, I’d rather be poor and true to myself than rich and costumed for the colonizers’ pleasure.
