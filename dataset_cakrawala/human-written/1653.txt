What began as an ordinary dayâ€¦.

So I thought today was going to be an ordinary day, but by 9am, I realised it was something very different.

If you have been following my Facebook posts over the last few weeks, you will see that we had a wonderful holiday in Canada with our three grown up kids (and our Canadian daughter)

For the past week I have been a bit in mourning. Our kids are scattered all over the world, and I miss them being part of our daily lives â€“ you know, dropping in for dinner, being able to meet the girls on a Saturday and go shopping, that type of thing.

I must admit to feeling a bit sorry for myself â€“ when we told our kids that it was important that they travel, move away from home to follow their dreams â€“ I didnâ€™t think they would listen (they didnâ€™t listen when I told them to clean up their rooms!!)

But today was a bit of a reality check

First thing this morning I received a message from my youngest daughter to tell me she got a new job. Five months ago she packed herself up and moved to Vancouver, all by herself. She didnâ€™t know a soul, had nowhere to live and no job. But in that time she has found a place to live, with some great roommates, found a job (a few actually) together with the help of a couple of amazing people she is feeling right at home in her new city.

Next a message from my son, who has been living in Montreal for 2 years. His job is going from strength to strength. He started out as a video editor and now a producer with one of Youtubeâ€™s biggest channels. His videos regularly get over 1 million hits and a few of them over 10 million. He loves his new life, as much as he loves his lovely girlfriend.

Then to top it off, I was listening to my daughter read breakfast news for one of the countryâ€™s most listened to Breakfast radio stations. She is normally the Drive Time newsreader , but today was filling in for her boss who is unwell â€“ her doing that means pulling a double shift! Today also happened to be the anniversary of the day six years ago that she first started in radio, in a small regional radio program, which meant she too had to move away from home.

So while I am sad that they are living away from home I am also exceptionally proud of the way they have created their success. All on their own, self directed, confident, believing in their ability to be their own people.

Thatâ€™s what true parenting is isnâ€™t it? Giving them wings to fly, and letting them do it.

So what does that mean for me?

Well their success and new life, gives me the freedom to do what I love to do best, mentor and work with women in their 50â€™s who want to be Fit and Fabulous. You see, thatâ€™s what I plan to do (although I may have to change that title to something beginning with â€˜Sâ€™, soon!) ðŸ˜‰

Because just because your kids move out of home, doesnâ€™t mean you have to stop, in fact, it means taking that amazing energy, wisdom and intuition and carving something just for you.

My children are a constant source of inspiration for me. They stay focused, they keep moving â€“ and so I can too! And thank goodness we live in the most wonderful time that I can talk to them all the time!
