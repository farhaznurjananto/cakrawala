I wandered over

to the meadow today,

expecting to see the field

ablaze with black-eyed Susans

dancing in the morning sun.

It’s the first time in years

I’ve returned to this field,

wanting to relive

the memory

of standing here with you.

But as I turn the bend,

no tapestry of yellow greets me.

A blanket of purple fireweed,

swaying on their green stalks,

spreads across the meadow.

Where are the black-eyed Susans?

When did all this change?

If you were here, you’d laugh

and use your favorite phrase,

“How jolly!

A new color scheme

to dive into!”

I sink into the grass until

the shade saturates me;

somewhere deep within,

maybe in my toes,

something nudges;

Perhaps I, too, can change

my vista,

my life.

Wherever you are,

I bet you’re smiling right now.
