Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is an American patriot. Having been awarded the Purple Heart is a testament to his courage on the battlefield.

As a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Army, I thank him for his service.

As an American, I applaud his courage to comply with a lawful subpoena and testify truthfully before Congress about his knowledge of President Trump’s “perfect call” with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

During his testimony, he told his dad “not to worry” because this was America. But as soon as President Trump was acquitted by the GOP-led Senate, Lt. Col. Vindman was summarily fired from the White House, along with his twin brother who had no involvement with the impeachment.

We’ve since learned that the White House directed the Secretary of Defense and the Department of the Army to “dig up dirt” on Lt. Col. Vindman so he could be fired. Try as they might, their efforts were fruitless.

As it turned out, Lt. Col. Vindman was unimpeachable.

On July 8th Lt. Col. Vindman submitted his request for resignation from the Army.

His attorney cited a campaign of “bullying, intimidation, and retaliation” by President Trump and his administration as the reason for Vindman’s resignation. He knew his career was over.
