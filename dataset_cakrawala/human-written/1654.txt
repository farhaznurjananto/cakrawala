Woman’s Work

Weaving Life

The women gathered in a small circle. It was easier that way. Easier to do their work, easier to pass Destiny from one to another.

The Maiden Clotho — youngest of the sisters — sat at her spinning wheel spinning thread after thread. This was her piece. Birthing the thread. Pulling it forth from the chaos of The Mother Thread, skillfully wielding her spindle, forming one perfect, beautiful bit of fiber.

The Mother Lachesis — the middle sister — would take the spun thread and measure it out. Some threads were measured long. Others were shorter. Much shorter. Most were rough, although every so often a thread as smooth as silk would appear. She was diligent and conscientious in her allotments.

The Crone Atropos — eldest sister of the three — would cut the threads at the lengths determined by Lachesis. She used her shears to make sure each thread was incised at precisely the correct place in precisely the correct manner. She was responsible for the unturning of the thread and for sending it back to The Mother Thread for Clotho to spin again.
