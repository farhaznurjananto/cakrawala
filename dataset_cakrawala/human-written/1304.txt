Former Arsenal and Liverpool star Jermaine Pennant has agreed a deal to join non-league hotshots Billericay Town.

Pennant, 34, is set to join the ambitious Essex club, who play in the seventh tier of English football.

He is set to make his debut in Billericay's pre-season friendly against Leyton Orient on Saturday, which will be the first game inside the club's renovated AGP Arena.

Pennant started this summer on trial at Hibernian, but boss Neil Lennon dropped his interested earlier this month.

The 2007 Champions League finalist was released by Bury, who he signed for following short spells in India and Singapore, at the end of last season.

Billericay are owned by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who is targeting crowds of over 4,000 for the new season.

Their average crowd last year was around the 500 mark.

Tamplin hit the headlines in May when he forced his team to sing R Kelly's World's Greatest before playing in a cup final.

He has since got the team to sing it again - before a pre-season friendly.
