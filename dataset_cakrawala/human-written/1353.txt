You are not mixing around enough

People who get married meet people before they get married. You can go out to your church, club, society, or go to meetup.com (website where people organise meetups). Just go and mix around, and eventually you may find the one you are looking for!

2. You need to look after yourself

Perhaps you are not in the best shape to attract a significant other. Areas you may have to look after are your emotions, spirituality and physicality. If you need to exercise, exercise more. If you need to manage your emotions, perhaps joining a social group may help. If you need more spirituality, perhaps find more meaning in your life. All this adds up to a very healthy person, that one will want to be with.

3. Come up with a list of traits of the ideal person

Maybe you just don’t know who’s right for you. In that case, come up with a list of traits of the ideal person. It can be something like — Seeks the truth, strong and muscular, loves art. This helps you to find the right person.

Happy holidays and hope you have fun getting to know the people around you! And hopefully, eventually find The ONE.
