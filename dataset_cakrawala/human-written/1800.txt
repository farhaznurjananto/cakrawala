Star-crossed

Poetry

In the dream she saw his silhouette,

slipping away with every passing moment.

It wasn’t sad though, atleast not yet.

Maybe she thought of it as an atonement,

the fleeting joy was only hers to covet.

He might not have enjoyed her company,

but his companionship she would not forget.

In the dream he walked away,

farther with every step.

It wasn’t sad though, atleast not today.

Maybe he thought of it as a favor,

for he could only bring her harm.

Her memories of him may vanish like vapor,

but he would treasure hers as long as he lived.

In the dream, Love watched it all unfold,

utterly helpless against a fate so cold.

It wasn’t sad though, not because of this.

There had been better times filled with bliss.

Maybe that’s why tragedies are immortalised,

not because of the pain they hold, but for the love they held.
