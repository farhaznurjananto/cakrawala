As a freelancer finding work can be tricky! With thousands of freelancer job sites out there, it can be overwhelming on where you should look and sign-up to. Some are over competitive, some are expensive, and some are just just there to waste your precious time. But of course, there are also good sites that offer good work. In this quick piece, I’m going to map out my top 4 (at this moment) marketplaces that work for me, in no particular order.

YunoJuno

YunoJuno is one of the leading freelance job sites. It offers really high quality jobs from high quality clients. The sign-up process requires some time, but I think it’s definitely worth it.

Bark.com

Bark is an another freelance job site that you can find pretty good gigs on. Bark doesn’t charge a membership fee, but be careful with paying for leads (sometimes it can come up to you spending £30 to actually getting a lead).

Wishu

Wishu is a fairly new marketplace within the UK scene. I joined wishu in April and got quite a few direct messages from clients inviting me to projects. If you’re a freelancer who is looking for a nice looking app that provides you with not only jobs but also good freelancer resources and you don’t want to spend money — you should check wishu out.

The-Dots

Okay, The-Dots is a professional network, not a marketplace. But hear me out, I have landed a few really amazing freelance gigs as-well-as great connections with some really interesting and big clients.

Please note that I will be going into greater detail on each of these sites separately, as-well-as comparing them. This is only Part 1. So stay tuned!
