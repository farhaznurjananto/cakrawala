When police lab techs testify, their findings can often make the prosecution's case.
But those lab coat-sporting crime fighters aren't perfect, and sometimes, they're not even close. As evidence, we turn to the curious case of Sonja Farak, who Sky News reports was high during most of the eight years she spent testing drugs for many Massachusetts police departments. Hilariously, she scored her methamphetamines, ketamine, cocaine, and LSD from lab samples. 
Findings in 30,000 cases were compromised. Here's what else happened this week:

In March, a RennList member found himself stranded in an intersection with an immobile 996. Speculation initially centered on a grenaded transmission, but this thread shows the importance of getting a second opinion.
 
We're going to bet that most of the folks on Motor Authority don't like the idea of hacking a central display so the driver could watch a movie. But the hack to do it on an A8 was enough to impress the folks on AudiWorld.
 
The idea of taking a rattle can to any vehicle, much less a Lamborghini Huracán, sounds like automotive heresy. This car was apparently wrapped beforehand, so it's reversible, and the 6SpeedOnline members dug it.
 
JaguarForums loves the XJS, but even devotees acknowledge the car isn't perfect. If it was being designed today, they'd love a truly powerful V-12, along with a stick and a host of other improvements outlined in this discussion.
 
The story of this barn find is still unfolding on CorvetteForum, but it looks like this new owner stumbled onto something special. It's a drag car from an old friend who used to apparently develop race engines with the factory.    

Hit the links to get the full story. And tune in next week for more news from the forums!
