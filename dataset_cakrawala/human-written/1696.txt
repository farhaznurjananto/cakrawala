Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport VitesseNot much is known about Bugatti’s successor for the Veyron supercar. That’s probably because the Veyron itself is still being built and the model after it, due around 2014, will be a production version of the Bugatti Galibier sedan concept.
This means that the Veyron’s successor is still quite a few years away, at the earliest, but that doesn’t mean Bugatti isn’t toying around with some ideas for its new flagship supercar.
Speaking with AutoExpress, Bugatti’s chief engineer Jens Schulenburg confirmed that work on the Veyron successor had already commenced.
Key challenges Bugatti’s engineers are hoping to address include reducing weight and introducing the very latest in technology. Some of the ideas Schulenburg and his team are looking at include using carbon fiber wheels and adopting hybrid technology.
Bugatti’s former boss Wolfgang Dürheimer is a strong proponent of hybrid technology, having introduced the technology to other Volkswagen Group brands Porsche and soon Bentley, and in the Bugatti, an electric mode would be a smart move in terms of reducing emissions. Around town most Veyrons are typically driven quite slow, so in these situations an electric mode would be ideal. Using electric motors to direct torque could also significantly improve the handling of the car, which opens up some very interesting possibilities.
One thing’s for certain, Bugatti’s Veyron successor, which some suggest will keep the Veyron name, will continue to be the world’s fastest production car. After all, having the fastest car in the world is a cornerstone of Bugatti’s current philosophy--something that doesn’t look to be changing anytime soon.
