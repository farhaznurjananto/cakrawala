Reunions

In early December 2018 I felt a nudge to write a spiritual novel. Many of the words would not be mine. I would fly around the fascinating and puzzling world of spirituality and weave it into a story.

Every fortnight in 2019 I published a chapter in a blog. I wrote because I loved inventing, researching and expressing emotion. I knew that experiences from my life would leak into the chapters as the book evolved. About 100 people followed the story. It was finished in early December 2019. I have no plans to publish it for money.

Reunions follows seven people who meet at Castlethorpe, a multi-faith, multi-dimensional college near the ancient city of St Albans. They make a pact to meet up now and then yet these reunions quickly evolve into a completely different form as they discover themselves, each other and the beautiful cosmic laboratory of life.
