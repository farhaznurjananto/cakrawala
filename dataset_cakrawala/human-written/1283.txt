Love Scene

Listen baby

Take one, baby lying on the bed, Exotic fantasies going through her head

Take two, I jump into my SL-6, I gotta make my way to the crib mad quick

Take three, I see my baby as I step inside, She’s starring at me with those bedroom eyes

Take four, Honey sipping on some chardonnay, The sex is even better when she’s feeling that way

All I wanna do right now is love her down, I don’t give a damn about who hears the sound, We’ll be in the groove until the sun comes up, Together we’ll get lost inside the love….

Let’s make a love scene, Steamy and blue, Erotic memories, For an audience of two, And we’ll make a love scene, Let the foreplay begin, And replay each moment, Again and again and again……

Take five, The jacuzzi is just about ready for us, We step into the water and you tremble at my touch

Take six, I see you getting steaming hot, Girl it ain’t just the bubbles that’s been hitting the spot

Take it all, Take it all till you get enough, Any way that you like is okay, Come and get my love……

Steamy sexy moving lyrical lines embedded within a love song simply in a class of it own. Performed by one of R & B’s all-time best singer/songwriters. Joe is a legend of his R&B genre. You can call on me at anytime and I can easily list a number of his hits songs I believe are simply amazing. You will appreciate this song much deeply when you drink from a fountain of love.

I’m still loving this song……

Check it out and have fun!
