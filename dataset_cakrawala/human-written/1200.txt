In something of a surprise turn, Ubisoft is releasing two GBA games from its backlog via the Wii U Virtual Console in North America. They’ll include Rayman Advance, a port of the very first game, and the handheld’s version of Rayman 3.

While neither game is seen as the ideal version to play, they do have their individual aspects. Rayman Advance was made easier due to the smaller screen space, meaning you can’t be hurt from above and you get an extra pip of health to start off.

As for Rayman 3, while the console versions are full 3D adventures the GBA port is a side-scroller, much like the first game.

While no pricing has been announced yet, other GBA games available via the Wii U eShop cost $7.99.
