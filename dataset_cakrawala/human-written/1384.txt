The idea is to do an all new, color graphic novel at the 'Golden-age' (or roughly Magazine) size format that picks up where we leave off on the web and tell a dramatic, action-packed completion to the current story arc. To that end, I wanted to sort of re-introduce the characters and concepts and reveal that a year or two has passed (so it’s 1950 or ‘51), so the diesel-punk flavor has been amped. Here was see JACK PARIS and JOSIE TAYLOR, HUNTER NOIR and MR. Mask of the Martian Killers in the hidden Underground Base beneath Coney Island, NY...The P-51s - as you may question - have been retrofitted with reverse-engineered 'Martian' technology. This allows them to use a sort of anti-gravity wave to get airbourne, then engage their prop engines and speed off and out of the hanger.Pgs 2-3 is a double-page spread, inked with microns on two 11x17 comic boards, Aprox. 40 hrs from concept to complete inks plus another day in Adobe Photoshop (with Special Thanks to Davi-ann and Bill Farmer)We could really use your support crowdfunding this project. Check out the video; you get to see me and some friends in 40s threads doing our own Newsreel to push the concept.
