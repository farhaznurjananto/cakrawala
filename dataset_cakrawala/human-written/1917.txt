🎵Can’t Keep Me Down Now🎵

My new song is the featured single at SaskMusic

Good news, friends.

“Can’t Keep Me Down Now,” a song I co-wrote with Brooklyn’s Doobie Duke Sims, has been selected as the week’s featured single by SaskMusic, a Canadian music industry organization. You can listen to the track here.

“Can’t Keep Me Down Now” is from the EP Cahoots, available on Apple Music and other platforms.

I hope you like the song, friends. It pairs well with a hot cup of coffee. ☕
