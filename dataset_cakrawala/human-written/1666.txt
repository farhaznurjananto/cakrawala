I was the biggest dessert lover in the world, I literally ate sugary croissants and brownies for breakfasts, and it’s not even an exaggeration. If I was hungry after lunch, I would eat Snickers as a snack. I could never say no to buying M&Ms with a bottle of Sprite before going to the movies. It was a routine, and I didn’t notice anything bad.

Then slowly I started exploring questions like how food affects our bodies, general health, and the environment. I understood how bad sugar is for my organism, it literally doesn’t give anything useful to it, even if it gives a boost in energy at first, then it takes it all away and you are left without any. Yes, sugar probably has something useful to our bodies, and there are no good and bad foods, but I think that such a mindset can drastically help you with getting rid of anything from your diet.

The average person in the US consumes around 71.14 grams(17 teaspoons) of added sugar per day, while the recommended intake amount is 25 to 38 grams. This is not surprising considering that almost every company adds sugar to food in order to make it’s taste better. In this article, by sugar, I mean added sugar, not the one we get from fruits and other natural foods.
