Strategies for Learning New Skills Faster

Like programming

Learning any new skill has become easier than ever due to the internet. We are just a few clicks away from any information.

Do you know that most people take an average of 25–30 days to complete a 30-hour course on Coursera/Udemy. Online MOOCs have a completion rate of less than 15%, which means that out of 1,000 people registered in a course, 850 of them never complete the course, and drop out.

But why do people drop out in the middle of a course? What could be the reason? Is the course not good, or don’t we have enough motivation to continue?

I conducted a survey of around 200 people, and here is what they say.

Survey Response — 1

Survey Response — 2

Some key insights:

More than 55% of people said they take more than one month of time.

More than 70% of people have a course-completion rate of approximately 50% or less.

Now, let’s see what the approaches are to learn any new skill faster.
