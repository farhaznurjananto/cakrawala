Bounce

Bitcoin is on pace to reclaim about half the ground lost last week and tracking the seventh weekly gain of the past ten.

Major stonks indices ended the week near the top end of their historic range as gold dropped through its 50-day moving average to a one-month low, the USD strengthened and the CNY continued to drift lower as the domestic real estate crisis unfolds.

Bitcoin, technically, continues to look interesting as the volatility squeeze highlighted over the previous two weeks continues to play out. Onchain data, fund flows and funding rates also look supportive.

The herd is coming

Blocksteam followed up on a string of positive headlines over the past few weeks with the successful completion of tranche three of the Blockstream Mining Note. Today’s tranche saw $5.5M of BMN orders filled in under two minutes.

Outside of that, news flow this week was led by institutional and corporate headlines with reports that Fidelity had met with the SEC to pitch its BTC ETF application, Cathie Wood reiterating her $500,000 Bitcoin target price, Coinbase junk bonds ~5x oversubscribed, and MicroStrategy reportedly selling $400M in stock to boost its Bitcoin holdings.

Canary in the CNY coal mine?

There’s a big bubble bursting in China, and it’s not Bitcoin.

The ongoing Evergrande saga is massive in scale: $300B in liabilities, commitments to complete 1.4 million properties, 16% of China’s total high-yield bond market, and swarms of disgruntled retail investors.

Evergrande is a systemically important company to China’s economy and the ripple effect could drive real pain; fire sales across real estate markets, evaporation of supply chain profit margins, and a nosedive in capital markets. The stakes are high and it’s unclear how this will be navigated.

China already has a lot on its plate with an ongoing economic slowdown, rising tensions with Western countries, and a crackdown on private sector companies from a broad range of industries — including Bitcoin.

I wonder if the Bitcoin crackdown is a canary in the coal mine, and perhaps part of a larger effort to tighten capital controls as the powers that be attempt to address escalating issues in China’s massive real estate market.

The surprise string of 2015 CNY devaluations took markets by surprise, and I think we’re a primary driver of Bitcoin’s grind higher in 2016 (chart below).

A repeat of that would be massively bullish for Bitcoin.

Cups, handles, and squeezes

Over the past two weeks, I’ve highlighted the volatility squeeze playing out and how last week’s dump was probably a head fake, so it’s encouraging to see price rebound back up around the 20-day moving average.

The overall setup continues to look supportive; Bitcoin saw +$60M in fund flows over the past two weeks and MicroStrategy buying has lifted BTC in corporate treasuries to around an all-time high, funding rates remain low, and charts on the crypto space as a whole look like they could be setting up for a broad-based break higher.

With both the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average sitting at $46,000, I think this is probably a fairly strong line of support. Just north of $52,000 marks both two standard deviations above the 20-day moving average and the price peak from a few weeks ago. This is probably the main line of near-term resistance.

Onchain data also looks increasingly positive, with indications that both small and large wallets are now pulling in the same direction for the first time in weeks.

What’s going on in China (Evergrande and real estate) is a bit off the Bitcoin radar at the moment, but could also be a massive Bitcoin price driver if it spills over into pressure on the CNY.
