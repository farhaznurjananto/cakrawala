No action needed by (XRP) Holders to claim tokens of the Flare Network

7 December 2020 — The global cryptocurrency exchange STEX announced today it will support the Flare Network token (Spark) airdrop program for Ripple (XRP) coin holders. The airdrop program will automatically delivery Spark tokens to all STEX Ripple (XRP) holders; no additional steps are necessary to claim the tokens at the Flare Network.

The Flare Network announced that a balance snapshot will be taken of all Ripple (XRP) holders on December 12, 2020. Spark tokens will then be apportioned to each remaining address according to their proportional XRP balance in the snapshot. Approximately 45 Billion Spark tokens are expected to be awarded to XRP holders when the Flare Network launches in 2021. The official date of the airdrop has not yet been announced.

STEX will subject the Flare Network (Spark) to its listing process and will determine at a future date if the token will be listed on its exchange.
