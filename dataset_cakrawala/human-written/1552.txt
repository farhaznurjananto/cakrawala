2 Questions to Ask When Making Hard Decisions

Being indecisive

I’ve always been an indecisive person. I could never pick from what color of the same shirt to buy or what job to take. One of them is more problematic than the other.

It would take me a very long time to choose, hoping that it was the “right” decision when I finally make one. When I do make a decision, doubts come rushing in, wondering if I made the right call. Again, it’s problematic.

I’ve been trying to change that lately. I encounter decision-making so often that I hate how much energy it takes up.

A few months ago, I started a second part-time job in another Emergency Department. I had an appreciation of technology in healthcare, so I wanted to be a part of the very first smart hospital in Toronto. And I wanted to leave my current job because of some issues.

I did my very best to compare the two hospitals to decide right away which job to pick during my 3-week orientation. I juggled between two stressful jobs in that time frame.

There were pros and cons to each decision. I was using my logical mind to decide, and I just couldn’t figure it out. I asked the people around me, and they all had their own opinions.

I finally found a way that works for me. I used to take days to make hard decisions, but now it’s less, maybe a few hours.

After a couple of coaching programs, this is what I learned:

I already know everything that I want.

Deep inside.

And so do you.
