Update: Microsoft confirmed to Game Informer the image is of the game's box art.

Today Microsoft emailed 32 slivers of a new Halo 4 image to fans of the series, and it took eager gamers all of an hour to piece together the puzzle. Check out the full image.

Fans in the Halo Waypoint forums united to solve the mystery, which appears to be an image of Master Chief standing underneath one of the alien ships from Independence Day. I'm pretty sure the ship will turn out to be something else and that Halo 4 won't be an epic Halo-Independence Day mash-up, but it should be. Make it happen, 343 Industries. We're sure Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum are available for voiceover work. Here's the image.

Halo 4 will release on Xbox 360 on November 6. For more on the game, head to our Halo 4 hub, which is full of exclusive features.
