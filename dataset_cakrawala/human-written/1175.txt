A centralized and a decentralized exchange, two currency pairs and two first markets for the LGO token.

We are very proud to announce that just 2 weeks after the official release, LGO tokens are now tradable on two different exchanges: BiBox and IDEX !

We chose to be traded both on a centralized and a decentralized in order to accommodate the needs of all LGO buyers â€” until LGO goes live ;)

You can start trading LGOBTC and LGOETH on Bibox, and LGOETH on IDEX
