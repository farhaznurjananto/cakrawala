Above, newly planted trees in Fleetwood Park, Mississauga, to increase shade and encourage people to enjoy the Park.

Unfortunately. although the City had the right idea to increase the trees along the bike and walking path, they failed to provide the appropriate care for them.

The extreme damage to the bark of the tree in the first image was caused by the person operating the string trimmer coming too close to the tree. This could easily have been avoided if when planting the tree, they had created a wider circle around the base of the tree and filled it with wood chips to keep the weeds down, and to help retain the moisture.

The other trees in the images above have also had their bark damaged from careless string trimming, and also they are failing from lack of water. Once the bark becomes so badly damaged that it circles the trunk, the tree is no longer able to take in nutrients, because the bark can no longer carry the flow of nutrients to the tree. It has effectively been “girdled”. Ultimately that tree will die.

The summer these saplings were planted was unusually hot and very dry. The trees got one watering when they were planted in July, but for the remaining months of summer and Fall, they were completely neglected. The result was that most of them died the following year.

I consider that to be a huge waste of taxpayer money and a huge loss to the community.

Those saplings died, and have not been replaced.
