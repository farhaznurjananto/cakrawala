MMO Entertainment stated, "We'll give the independent label our full support and help to introduce an effective system so that the two idols mature as musicians following their Wanna One activities. We ask that you give your love and support for Kang Daniel and Yoon Ji Sung as Wanna One members until then."

It's reported Kang Daniel and Yoon Ji Sung decided to band together, since they've maintained their friendship training under B2M Entertainment and MMO Entertainment together.

Look forward to Kang Daniel and Yoon Ji Sung's next steps!
