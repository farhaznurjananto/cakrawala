Beyond This Moment

The space between lines

is thin.

The race between time

is won, when

winners realize

time is faster than them.

We’ll never catch up;

time is faster than wind.

And if we ever catch up

that’s when time will end.

Let real life begin,

and reality will blend

with now.

And this moment will finally

be found.

And this moment will finally

be still.

But until

this moment is finally hours

with no minutes;

and ours

with no limits;

and ours

with no endings.

Only beginnings.

Only extending.

Only upending

all we once knew,

but have quickly forgotten.

All we pursue

that’s been useful for nothing.

Be in this moment

before beyond this moment

is now.
