Fisker Automotive is less than a year away from launching its new Karma plug-in hybrid luxury saloon, arguably one of the most stylish looking cars on the auto show circuit, not to mention one of the cleanest too. While big name carmakers like General Motors and Toyota struggle to launch mass-market plug-in hybrid vehicles by the end of the decade, Fisker will have its Karma on the roads this November and a sexy convertible version by 2011.
Never one to rest on its laurels, Fisker is already looking towards launching its next model: a low cost, high volume plug-in hybrid. Speaking to Reuters at this week’s Geneva Motor Show, Fisker chief Henrik Fisker revealed that with a little help from the government the niche carmaker could have a new model on sale within 26 months. 
Fisker is in the process of seeking an undisclosed loan amount from the Department of Energy (DOE), which it hopes to use for the low-cost model as well as the refurbishment of an existing U.S. factory to build the cars. 
However, before the low-cost model, Fisker will build a more practical and family-oriented version of the Karma. No other details have been released about this car but expect a detuned version of the Karma’s ‘Q-Drive’ powertrain feature in it. 
The Karma will go on sale in the U.S. this November with a starting price of $87,900 and will hit European showrooms in the second quarter of next year priced from €78,780. Fisker, together with independent vehicle manufacturer Valmet, plans to build up to 15,000 Karmas per year, half of which will be sold in the U.S. and the other half in Europe.2009 Fisker Karma plug-in hybridFisker Karma plug-in hybrid convertible
