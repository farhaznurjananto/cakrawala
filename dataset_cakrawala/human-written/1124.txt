In the middle of last night, I remembered an article I had read some years ago regarding a writing project-writing 100 words everyday for 100 days-on anything you want to write about. Everyday, without fail, whether anyone reads it or not, whether you get anything out of it or not. No matter the obstructions in your path, no matter how late in the night or how early in the morning it gets, you have to punch out those 100 words every single day. I wasn’t “selected” for that project, but I realised what’s stopping me from doing it anyway? With the New Year popping open in less than 10 days, the idea of starting this from 1st seemed extremely lucrative, then again “jab jaago tabhi savera”. So here goes Day 1 of my 100 Day Writing Project. I hope to see you on the other side.
