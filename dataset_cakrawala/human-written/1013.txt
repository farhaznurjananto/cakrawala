RoK Update Alpha 11

This update contains some major backend changes to help prevent hacking. Servers were wiped with this update, we recommend for community servers to be wiped as well.We have integrated Easy Anti Cheat (EAC) with the game, and you will be required to install it before running the game. EAC will run in the background after you launch Reign of Kings, when you are done playing, EAC will stop running. We felt it was best to have a major anti-hacking solution on our side while we also work to prevent exploits and hacks on our end. We also included another layer of our own hack prevention in this update aside from EAC. You will now also be required to agree to our EULA before playing the game. We hope everyone understands that we are doing our best to prevent hacking, and we hope some of these solutions help out. We will continue to make this our top priority in the near future.Do not risk hacking/exploiting the game, as this may result in your account being permanently banned through the EAC system. Bans will be delivered in waves, we will not elaborate on the exact timing.Edit: If you are experiencing error "Please run from Reign of Kings.exe" - please try restarting windows to fix this.For Community Servers (to stop your players being stuck on downloading characters):You will need to delete your permission file, don't worry, it will auto-generate when you restart your server. Otherwise users may experience problems with users connecting to your server (stuck on downloading characters). Please clear your permission file. The permission file is located under the Configuration folder next to your ROK.exe.For more info on upgrading your server to Alpha 11:As with the last update - Due to the current anti-hacking layers, modding of the game is not permitted at this time, this would include language packs or other localization attempts. Please verify the integrity of your game cache and keep your DLLs and game files unmodified to avoid unwanted banning or being added to a ban list. If you are unsure you can verify your game files through steam by selecting "Verify Integrity of Game Cache..." in your game's properties under "Local Files".If verifying your files does not work, and you keep getting banned for DLL mismatch, delete your local game folder and redownload from steam.1) Right click your Reign of Kings game in your game list 2) Select "Delete Local Content..."3) ReinstallLooking forward to the next week, our main focus will once again be on hack prevention, and also on performance.This update also includes many bug fixes, design changes, and some new features like a trap door & furniture.
