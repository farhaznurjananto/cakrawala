The new WordPress Twenty Fifteen theme is pretty nice. But if you’ve just activated this theme and you’re using Disqus as a comment system, you might have noticed the comments don’t look right:

Here’s how I fixed the problem..

Update as of 12/23/2014 11:51:16 AM: I’ve done more more work to better integrate Disqus into the Twenty Fifteen theme since I originally created this post..

Basically, Disqus isn’t inheriting the same background color, margin, and padding properties as the rest of the post.

The easiest way to fix it is to install Jetpack. This will give you the ability to have custom CSS in your WordPress theme.

Go to Appearance > Edit CSS:

Then copy/paste the following CSS into the window:

div#disqus_thread { padding: 3% 10%; background-color: white; margin: 3% 0; box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.15); } @media screen and (min-width: 38.75em) { div#disqus_thread { margin: 3% 7.6923%; } } @media screen and (min-width: 59.6875em) { div#disqus_thread { margin: 3% 8.3333%; } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 div#disqus_thread { padding : 3% 10% ; background-color : white ; margin : 3% 0 ; box-shadow : 0 0 1px rgba ( 0,0,0,0.15 ) ; } @media screen and (min-width: 38.75em) { div#disqus_thread { margin : 3% 7.6923% ; } } @media screen and (min-width: 59.6875em) { div#disqus_thread { margin : 3% 8.3333% ; } }

Save it, and take a look at your post again:

MUCH better!
