There seems to be a constant debate between whether, or not women should be able to have an abortion. I think that it is quite ridiculous that this topic of conversation is even being argued about. If it is not your body then you shouldn’t have any say. Lawmakers try to insert themselves into the lives of women who may be going through hell. You never know what the women’s reasoning is behind an abortion, and quite honestly it is none of your business. Mind. Your. Own. Uterus. Period. One cannot possibly account for all of the circumstances behind abortion. Would you want to carry your rapists baby? Would you put your own life in danger just to have a baby? What if you do drugs… that’s going to be passed onto the kid. Imagine working multiple jobs and trying to raise a kid, well that’s what some mothers have to do. Now I know you may be thinking, “well what about abortion?” Well that is not taking into account the fact that the woman may be putting herself at risk physically. Also, even carrying a pregnancy is a huge decision that should never be pushed onto a woman. The next time that you’re thinking about supporting pro-life, remember that if it’s not your body then it is not your choice.
