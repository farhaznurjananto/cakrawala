Fuck all the

Nazi parties

Antifascists parties I

Don’t fuck with too.

I don’t give a fuck about

Your Moscow parties —

I’m in real protest in Seattle

Where there are street fights

Every God damn day.

Broken faces.

As boys wild runnin’ in Chechnya.

Everybody is has a ‘round

Of a loaded firearm in their pants.

And they are comparing

With each other

Those fucking fagots

Who’s lady is wearing a better

Lipstick

And who has the longer

Dick.

God damn idiots.

This is America, baby.

Anyone can

Assault you,

Stab you

Hit you in the head

With the brass knuckles

Hit your face,

Or take you out

w/ the 0.40

Caliber

Like in CS: Go.

Oh, no.

Just because

You looked at a wrong

Guy.

Or said something

That he didn’t

Like.

Like the word “Niger”

That you’ve dropped

In the wrong area.

Here is not like in your area

Where you would

Come up with a story

From your area.

No bro, I’m sorry —

Not this

Time.

Here quickly

I will correct

Your Ego

And inner spine.

Like a morning sun,

That has not yet risen

You will be

Quiet.

Watching your mouth

And being careful

If you want your mom

Or your wife

To once again see you

Alive.

Don’t forget —

We live only once.

So don’t waste

Your poor health

To behave like a fagot:

Better take a book in your hands

Or a laptop.

‘Cuz man,

Here or

There -

I will drop you

Fast.

Your gun is already

Taken away,

Discharged,

You — disarmed,

Disassembled.

And at the same time were

Disarmed and disabled

All the rest

Of your guys.

Didn’t even fire. Lol

Like beating a minor

Who are stubbornly beg

For what he

Wanna get

What he’s shouldn’t

He’s rude; you tell him “you can’t!”

But he

Don’t care.

One.. two, one more

Left once more —

And now you are in another world

No longer so aggressive and lonely.

You are laying

On the grass

A minute passes.

Trembling all over

You take out your phone

To remember

That no one wants to see your face

As well as your stupid person.

You drop it

Shit in your pants …

Ew, fuck

You wanna

Peice of paper?

You dropped it.

Dialing 911

But they don’t give a fuck

About your dumb problems

So a firetryckl

Sending you to the bed rest

How quickley

I sent you

To see the dentist

Damn it was done

Neatly.

Your Zumba online-classes

Taught you wrong

You are just like

Another thing in the world

That gone

Wrong.

I’m selling on the streets

Broken faces

Of random dumb fucks

Like I was taught in China

By my teachers

From The Shaolin

For 5 years

Straight.

You’re wining and crying

Like a pussy

With the fucking snot

All around yourself.

Finally you found out

What happens.

Sometimes.

Now you will have

A little more patience.

To the world around you in general

You will hold

Some more

Respect.

You will give a shit on those who around

And you will keep your trap shut.

Now you won’t hit

On someone else’s GF

Or tell tell that retarded joke

That your retarded friend

Taught you

Fucking jocker.

And on your own Language

You will magically learn

How to understand

Simple words

Like “No” is No

And even complex

Sentences.

You will consider my

Offer

Next time I’ll offer;

When girls

Don’t like

Your offers.

Post-apocalypse, fuck!

Free country.

What do you think

It will be Okay

That you

By confusing the gate

And from the wrong garage

Leaving in the morning

And accidentally

Stumbled upon

A wrong

Convict?

It will just go

Away?

* * *

Since you live

In the greatest country in the world

Behave

Correspondingly.

Don’t be such a

Piece of shit

Irresponsible.

And then go ahead

To find me:

Good luck!

Go look up

The cameras

For some luck:

Maybe you can catch

That video.

To watch

And then

Watch me

Geting away from the trial

Responsibility.
