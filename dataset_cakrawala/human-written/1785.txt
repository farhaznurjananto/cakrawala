+1 details DIY friction fit shorty


This is what it looks like:


And on my Nemesis/Patriot:


I'll have to widen the bore but that's for tomorrow.


Now, because it's impossible to shape it like most friction fit drip tips (minimally tapered) and due to no o-rings it only fits the atty I was fitting it to. On my others it either goes in so hard that it's a pain to get it out or doesn't go in at all or falls out, so that's a con. For what I wanted it's perfect :) I didn't really like the look of this drip tip, it was a tad too big for me, but I still wanted a heat resistant blue tip. So I sanded off the threads from the Delrin part bit by bit, checking if it fits my atty after every few swipes, until it went in perfectly.This is what it looks like:And on my Nemesis/Patriot:I'll have to widen the bore but that's for tomorrow.Now, because it's impossible to shape it like most friction fit drip tips (minimally tapered) and due to no o-rings it only fits the atty I was fitting it to.
