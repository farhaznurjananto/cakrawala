Artist: Connie McClung

I am always warm, and sometimes wet.

My father holds me in big hands, high above the ground.

Tall men walk around me, and one holds me.

The other tall man keeps his distance; a smaller man sits nearby.

Women also hold me, one brittle and dry, emanating vast love like perfume,

Two are rounder, softer, hotter,

I feel drowsy when I lie against them.

They are not the main woman, the mother,

Who is smaller, spare but soft enough,

With a quick voice and wide smile, and milk.

I see blurry interesting things.

Shadows spinning in circles,

Brights and darks.

I hear murmurs, animal pants and grunts,

A few sharp barks and shouts.

Sometimes my body jerks in startlement, but I am not afraid.
