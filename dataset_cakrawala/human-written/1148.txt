Here Are Seven Memes To Remind Us Of Key Lessons From History

Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. Here are 7 lessons we should never forget

Memes are a dime a dozen on the internet these days — but precious few relate to history.

In an effort to remedy the dearth of nerdy history memes, I’ve created seven new ones below in the hopes that they will both entertain and serve as important lessons for all students of history.

Here we go:

#7: How to invade Russia

#6: Don’t dare someone to cross a red line — if you can’t enforce it

#5: Don’t write a blank cheque if you can’t cash it

#4: Careful taking territory that doesn’t belong to you

#3: A treaty doesn’t count if you’ve got your fingers crossed

#2: It isn’t always the safest to be the one in control

#1: Don’t poke a sleeping bear
