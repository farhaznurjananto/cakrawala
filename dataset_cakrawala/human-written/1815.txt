This is such a great story and we need this right now. I am such a classical music lover, an amateur violinist.

I went to concerts since I was a little child. I always have seen white people in the audience: when playing myself as well as when I went to concerts. This issue you mentioned never caught my attention until I read your story. I never thought about it.

Now I will think about it more often. Thank you very much for this great story and let me think about it.

To me, you're an inspiration, and I have seen some work of yours â€” conducting as well as writing, and you're good!!!
