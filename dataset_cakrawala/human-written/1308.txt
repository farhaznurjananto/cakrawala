Introduction

After you have performed data cleaning, data visualizations, and learned details about your data it is time to fit the first machine learning model into it. Today I want to share with you a few very simple lines of code that will divide any data set into variables that you can pass to any machine learning model and start training it.

It is trivially simple but an understanding of how the split function for training and test data sets work is crucial for any Data Scientist. Letâ€™s dive into it.
