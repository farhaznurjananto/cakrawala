Asian Street Eatery, Sunnyvale

Asian Street Eatery opened on El Camino Real in Sunnyvale last week with a massive menu inspired by China and Southeast Asia’s “legendary” street food stalls. Normally a menu this large — including dim sum, baos, mantou, customizable banh mi sandwiches, noodle soups, braised meats and build-your-own stir fries — would be a red flag, but the food here is well worth exploring.

The restaurant comes from the same owners of Ginger Cafe in Sunnyvale, Fu Kee in San Jose, and Rice + Noodles Asian Kitchen in Campbell. You’re greeted by large, touch-screen kiosks on which you place your order — no need to come within 6 feet of a human — and can get it to-go or eat on a large outdoor patio.

Do try the squid ink dumplings, filled with sweet, oceanic lobster and corn encased in a dumpling skin shaped like a shell you’d find on the beach. And don’t miss the zhua bing, a massive Chinese pancake wrapped around lettuce, a Chinese donut, pickled carrots and radishes, cucumbers, cilantro and your choice of protein (the grilled pork was rich and delicious).
