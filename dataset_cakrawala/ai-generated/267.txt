The Blues Brothers, a primetime animated comedy series, is set to be shopped around to television platforms this month. The show is co-created and executive produced by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi’s widow, Judy Belushi, along with Emmy-winning original Saturday Night Live writer, Anne Beatts. The series will follow Jake and Elwood Blues on their music, mayhem, and comedy adventures, along with the characters within their blues band. The Blues Brothers will feature a score and soundtrack curated with soul, blues, and R&B classics and hits performed by the Blues Brothers, as well as new performances recorded specifically for the show. 

Aykroyd explained that “the show will be the Blues Brothers living in America and utilizing all new technology to make and promote their own records, seek out and record new artists and avoid law enforcement – and all while fighting for truth, justice and a better breakfast sandwich.” Aykroyd and Judy Belushi had been looking to mount a Blues Brothers animated series for a decade, and they had previously licensed the rights to Film Roman in 1997 for an animated series that was never launched. The duo began pitching a second Blues Brothers animated primetime series to networks in 2011, and they brought the current animated incarnation to Bento Box Entertainment to executive produce by Scott Greenberg, Joel Kuwahara, John W. Hyde, and Eric Gardner.

The Blues Brothers first debuted as musical guests on a 1978 Saturday Night Live episode hosted by Steve Martin. This led to an Atlantic Records recording contract and a national tour. Their debut album, “Briefcase Full of Blues” sold more than 3.5 million copies, and in 1980, the John Landis-directed film, The Blues Brothers, grossed more than $100 million worldwide. Universal Music Group recently announced the formation of Blues Brothers Records, a joint venture between Dan Aykroyd, Judy Belushi, and Eric Gardner aiming to give aspiring blues artists a home and global voice.

Bento Box Entertainment, known for their work on Bob’s Burgers, will produce the show. The company is represented by WME and Ziffren Brittenham.
