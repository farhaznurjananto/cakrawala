Five days after allegations against Harvey Weinstein first surfaced, Amazon Studios has canceled director David O. Russell’s untitled period drama series.

The drama, set in the 1970s, was to center on the personal and professional lives of a con artist and his mistress who were working as government spies.

The move came with Russell, who was set to executive produce and direct the project, still in talks with Amazon about the series.

The director’s previous credits include Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and Three Kings.

Amazon’s decision comes as Weinstein, who was also set to executive produce the series, is facing accusations of sexual harassment and assault from multiple women.

The accusations against Weinstein were first reported by the New York Times on Thursday.

In a statement to the Times, Weinstein said, “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.”

On Sunday, Weinstein was fired from The Weinstein Company, which he co-founded with his brother Bob.

Weinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex.

In a statement to Deadline, Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke said, “The reports of misconduct by Harvey Weinstein are deeply disturbing, and we have decided to cancel the project. Our decision is based on the continuing reports of misconduct against him.”

The series was set to be produced by Weinstein’s company, The Weinstein Company.

Salke added, “We are committed to doing what is right and fair, and we will continue to work with all of the parties involved to find a resolution.”

Weinstein is still under investigation by the NYPD and has been sacked from his company.

In a statement to Deadline, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said, “The District Attorney’s Office has been monitoring the developments in the Harvey Weinstein case and will continue to do so.”

The series was to have been set in Los Angeles and feature a cast that included Emma Roberts, Evan Peters, Patricia Arquette and Allison Janney.
