Masahiro Sakurai, the director of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, is deeply committed to the process of adding new characters to the popular game - even at the cost of his mental and physical health. In a recent interview with Polygon, Sakurai explained the time-consuming nature of choosing the game's roster, ensuring proper game balance, animation, graphics, and sound for each character.

During E3, Nintendo unveiled footage of the next Super Smash Bros. game, featuring returning favorites like Mario, Link, Pikachu, and Kirby, as well as three new fighters: Mega Man, Villager from Animal Crossing, and the Wii Fit Trainer. Sakurai highlighted the difficulty involved in removing characters from the game, as this causes considerable distress for devoted players who identify with those characters.

Sakurai believes the core of a Smash Bros. game hinges on its roster, as each character defines the experience differently for players. To make these decisions, Sakurai starts with his own thoughts and considers various surveys, refining the list of potential characters according to their uniqueness and contribution to the game's universe.

The addition of Mega Man to the Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS roster is a direct result of fan demand, with the character being the second most requested guest after Sonic the Hedgehog. Sakurai revealed that Capcom was very enthusiastic about the inclusion, resulting in a smooth and quick approval process.

Sakurai and his team at Sora Ltd. and Namco Bandai also take great care when redesigning returning characters. They start from scratch with each character to ensure they are appropriately represented on new hardware, taking into account factors such as game balance, visual fidelity, and graphical styles across the Wii U and 3DS versions of the game.

Sakurai reflected on the development process of his last Smash Bros. game in 2008, acknowledging that fans should expect less communication from him during the development of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS. Instead, "daily visual updates" will be posted to Miiverse and on the game's official website.
