Despite his invocation of socialist principles, Wang was quick to tell me that, despite having used the term himself, he dislikes the New Left label. "In the 1980s, intellectuals reacted against 'leftism,' blaming it for all of China's problems," he said, "and right-wing radicals use the words 'New Left' to discredit us, making us look like Maoist remnants." Wang also refuses to be associated with the radical intellectuals of the 1960s in America and Europe, to whom the term "New Left" was first applied. Many of them, he claimed, had passion and slogans but little practical political experience, and not surprisingly, many of them joined the neoconservatives, supporting "fantasy projects" like democracy in Iraq. Wang prefers the term "critical intellectual" for himself and like-minded colleagues, some of whom are also part of China's nascent activist movement in the countryside, working to alleviate rural poverty and environmental damage. Despite being predominantly left-wing, Dushu publishes writing from across the ideological spectrum. Wang's own work is influenced by a wide range of Western thinkers, from French historian Fernand Braudel to globalization theorist Immanuel Wallerstein. "Intellectual quality is important to me," Wang said. "I don't want to run any old left-wing nonsense." He claims that the magazine has published abstract debates on postcolonial theory as well as some of the most interesting analyses in China of how the government's urban-focused reforms have harmed rural society. Of course, there are constraints on what Dushu can publish, and Wang is open about them. Authors and editors at Dushu, like all intellectual journals in mainland China, must practice self-censorship. Articles cannot directly criticize the leadership or deviate significantly from the official line on sensitive subjects such as Taiwan or restive Muslim and Buddhist minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. "In Western countries, people ask me, 'How do you define your position?'" Wang stated. "a) a) b) c) d) d) d) d) d) No, I say. What exactly is a dissident? It falls into the cold-war category. And it no longer has any meaning. Many Chinese dissidents in the United States can return to China. But they refuse to. They are doing well in the United States. When people ask if we are dissidents, I tell them we are critical intellectuals. Some government policies are supported by us. Others, we disagree. It is entirely dependent on the policy's content." Wang, who was born in Yangzhou, Jiangsu's southeast province, was just seven years old and starting primary school when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. Wang appears to have had pleasant memories of the decade-long chaos that traumatized older generations. During the school year, he recalls being sent to work in the villages for a week or two. "My generation of urban intellectuals," he said proudly, "is the last to have firsthand experience of rural conditions." He considers the 20 months he spent working in factories near Yangzhou after finishing middle school to be valuable experience. In 1977, he took the first university entrance exams after the Cultural Revolution, when many universities were closed or would only admit peasants, workers, and soldiers. "Thousands of aspiring students were competing for a single place," he recalled. Wang found himself in an even more privileged class when he moved from Yangzhou to Beijing to begin his doctoral studies in the mid-1980s. "Intellectuals had been targeted during Mao's time; now, post-Mao, they were the elite again," he explained. And by then, they were all in agreement on what needed to be done, according to Wang: China needed to abandon its "feudal" and socialist traditions and catch up with the capitalist West. Intellectuals in China, scarred by the Cultural Revolution, saw socialism as a failure. As a result, Wang contends, there was no real debate in China about whether a Western-style consumerist society could be successfully recreated or was environmentally sustainable. The West, particularly the United States, was romanticized. Wang first began to develop his own views on contemporary China while working on a dissertation about one of the most admired of modern Chinese writers, Lu Xun (1881 1936). Wang explained that Lu Xun was a left-wing writer who was harshly critical of other left-wing writers and activists. He criticized Chinese tradition while also being a superb classical scholar. He accepted the Western concept of progress, but he was skeptical of it. The paradoxes in Lu Xun helped Wang see that Chinese modernity could not be as simple as rejecting the old and embracing the new, as both Maoists and free-market capitalists had done.
