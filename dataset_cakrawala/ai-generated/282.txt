surprise for me, too. I was just a small guy, and I was playing against big guys. I was so excited to be there, and I had a chance to play in the tournament. I think I was ready for it. I was so happy to score, and I think it was a good experience for me. I was so happy to score. I was so happy to help the team.

The World Junior Championship is an annual tournament for 19-year-old players, and it is one of the most prestigious and popular hockey tournaments for juniors. This tournament is not just an opportunity for the best of the best to show their talent, but also a great opportunity for players to develop their skills. Slovakia has only won one medal (bronze) in the tournament's history, making it a very challenging tournament for them. However, Tomas Tatar, who was 18 years old and a virtual unknown before the 2009 WJCs, managed to stand out and lead the team in scoring with seven goals and 11 points in seven games.

This impressive performance earned him the attention of Detroit Red Wings, who drafted him in the second round the following June. Despite his young age, Tatar decided to focus on playing professionally in the AHL, and he soon became one of the top scorers on the Griffins. His success in the AHL proved that his performance at the WJCs was not a fluke and he was a steal for Detroit at 60th overall.

Tomas Tatar's experience shows that the World Junior Championship is a great opportunity for young players to show their talent and develop their skills. It is also a great way for them to turn some heads and get noticed by scouts and teams.
