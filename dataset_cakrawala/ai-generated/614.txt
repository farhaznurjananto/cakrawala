Studies have long demonstrated that men and women approach problems requiring cooperation differently. Now, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have discovered how these differences are reflected in brain activity. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, could provide insight into the evolution of cooperative behavior between the sexes and potentially inform the development of new ways to enhance cooperative behavior.

While previous behavioral studies had already observed that women are more cooperative when being watched by other women, men tend to cooperate better in larger groups overall, and mixed-sex pairs cooperate in more diverse ways, the neurological basis for these differences had remained scarce. To explore this topic further, the Stanford researchers used a technique called hyperscanning to simultaneously record brain activity in pairs of same-sex and mixed-sex study participants while they interacted. Instead of using MRI, which requires lying still, the researchers employed near-infrared spectroscopy, allowing participants to sit upright and interact more naturally. In total, 222 participants took part, each assigned a partner of either the same or opposite sex.

The researchers observed that on average, male pairs performed better than female pairs in the cooperative tasks. However, the brain activity in both same-sex pairs was highly synchronized during the activity, indicating high levels of "interbrain coherence." Furthermore, increased coherence correlated with better performance on the cooperative task within same-sex pairs, but the location of coherence differed between male and female pairs.

Interestingly, male-female pairs performed just as well as male pairs in the cooperative tasks, despite not showing coherence. Future research may reveal how these sex-related differences in brain activity inform cooperation strategy.

Lead author Joseph Baker noted that the study is "pretty exploratory" and not representative of cooperation in all its forms. There may be other cooperative tasks where female pairs could outperform men. Moreover, the researchers did not measure activity in all parts of the brain, suggesting there could be other regions responsible for interbrain coherence.

The scientists' ongoing research could help uncover how cooperation evolved in humans and inform methods that use biofeedback to teach cooperation skills. "We're absolutely hoping to learn enough information so that we might be able to design more effective therapies for [individuals with disorders like autism who have problems with social cognition]," explained Baker.
