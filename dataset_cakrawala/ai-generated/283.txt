On Tuesday, President Trump is set to meet with the “Big Four” congressional leaders - Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) – as they scramble to negotiate a spending bill that would prevent a government shutdown. With tensions high between the two parties, Democrats hope to work out an immigration deal into the mix, while Republicans are adamant about keeping it separate from the funding bill.

The Democrats’ proposal for an immigration deal has come under fire from the White House, with Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley warning that “Democrats should not hold government funding hostage to their own pet legislative projects, which would jeopardize our national security.”

The two parties have been at odds for months over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era initiative that extended protections to undocumented immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as children. Trump announced in September that he plans to wind down the program by March, giving Congress six months to craft legislation that would preserve temporary legal status for the roughly 800,000 people eligible for the program.

However, Democrats have suggested that an immigration deal must be tied to the short-term funding bill lawmakers expect to pass while Republicans are pushing for just appropriations. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has advocated for attaching DACA legislation to the spending bill but the White House has made it clear that they have no intention of doing so, citing their focus on tax reform.

Though Democrats have threatened to vote against any funding mechanism that fails to address the DACA program, Democratic congressional leaders have not signaled whether they will insist on folding a DACA fix into the spending bill. If they do, the partisan battle could lead to government shutdown as both parties remain split on a range of other issues as well, including defense appropriations and disaster relief.

The upcoming meeting between Trump and the congressional leaders could prove to be decisive in the fight to avert a shutdown with only three weeks remaining on the legislative calendar. It’s unclear whether Democrats will be able to reach a DACA deal without risking the current agenda of tax reform, funding for the military and other essential operations, as well as health care and disaster relief.
