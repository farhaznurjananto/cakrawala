Q: Is there any room left at the inn? -- Teri.

A: The Miami Heat roster is filling up quickly and unless some veteran salaries are shed, the younger players may be left out. The current depth chart consists of Whiteside, Andersen, and Haslem at center; Bosh, McRoberts, and Stoudemire at power forward; Deng, Winslow, and Zoran Dragic at small forward; Wade, Green, and Richardson at shooting guard; and Goran Dragic, Chalmers, and Napier at point guard. This puts the Heat at the 15-player regular-season limit, leaving no room for Ennis, Johnson, Walker, or other summer roster players. A practical solution would be moving Birdman and Chalmers out to make room for Johnson and Ennis, considering the Heat's tax issues. With Zoran Dragic and Udonis Haslem deemed untouchable, it may require some creativity to accommodate the rest of the team. If money were not a factor, the 15 originally mentioned players provide Miami with their best chance of winning.

Q: Wade also wrote "one more year" on his Instagram. Does that mean he's planning on leaving? -- Ariel.

A: It is essential not to read too much into every player's remarks, especially after signing a new contract. Dwyane Wade is in for the upcoming season, and his Instagram post signifies his excitement for another year with the Heat. It is likely that Wade agreed to a one-year lifetime contract and will be accommodated for at least another season, as well as any remaining seasons he chooses with Miami. As time goes on, Wade may grow into a veteran presence within the team, but for now, everything looks promising.

Q: Must you always mention the fire extinguisher when referring to Amare? -- Rich.

A: Rest assured, no fire extinguishers are near the Miami Heat locker room. So, in this case, there should be no concerns.
