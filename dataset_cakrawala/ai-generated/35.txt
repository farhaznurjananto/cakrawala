Last week, fraternities near the University of Maryland were forced to suspend all activities after the death of a student.

Now, the university has indefinitely suspended all Greek life on campus.

The university is investigating the death of 19-year-old sophomore Jordan Hankins, who was found unresponsive in her dorm room on Monday.

The school says Hankins was not a member of any Greek organization, but her death has prompted the university to suspend all fraternities and sororities while they investigate.

In a statement, university president Wallace Loh said, "Fraternities and sororities at the University of Maryland have a long and proud history. However, the serious concerns arising from the death of one of our students require that we take decisive action."

Loh said the university will be conducting a "thorough review" of Greek life on campus and that they will be working with students, staff, and alumni to determine the future of Greek organizations at Maryland.

This is the second time in the past year that Greek life has been suspended at the university. In December, the university suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

This decision comes after a series of high-profile deaths in Greek life across the country. In March, the University of Cincinnati suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

And in November, the University of Oklahoma suspended all Greek life after the death of a student who was also not a member of a Greek organization.

This decision by the University of Maryland follows the lead of other universities across the country, who are responding to the spate of deaths in Greek life by suspending all activities.

The decision by the University of Maryland is likely to cause a lot of backlash from Greek life on campus. Greek life at the university is a big part of the social life on campus, and many students are likely to feel that their presence is being unnecessarily restricted.

There is also the question of whether or not Greek life is really to blame for the death of Jordan Hankins. It is possible that Hankins died from a genuine medical issue, and that her death has nothing to do with her involvement in Greek life.

Overall, this decision by the University of Maryland is a step in the right direction, and it is hopefully the start of a long-term change in the way that Greek life is conducted
