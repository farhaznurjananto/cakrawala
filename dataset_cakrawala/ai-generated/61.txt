San Francisco First City in the Nation to Establish a Community College District

In 1909, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to establish a community college district. In this same year, the San Francisco Community College District was founded, which currently comprises nine community colleges, serving over 80,000 students in the Bay Area.

The first community college in the district, City College of San Francisco, opened its doors in September of 1909 with an enrollment of just over 1,000 students. Today, City College of San Francisco is the largest community college in California, with an enrollment of over 100,000 students.

San Francisco is also home to the oldest continuously operating community college in the state of California, San Francisco City College, which was founded in 1934. Other community colleges in the district include San Francisco State University, San Francisco Junior College, and East Bay Community College.

The community college district has been a driving force in the growth of the Bay Area economy, and has helped to fill the gap in education caused by the region's high cost of living. In addition, the district has been a major player in the development of innovative educational programs and curricula, and has been a leader in the fields of adult education and workforce training.

Today, the community college district is one of the most powerful educational institutions in the Bay Area, and is responsible for training more than 80,000 students each year in a wide range of disciplines.
