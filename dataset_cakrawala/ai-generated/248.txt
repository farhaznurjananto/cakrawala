Hell, the notorious Dark Web hacking forum, has resurfaced online after it was shut down last year when personal details of users were found on the site. Hell was first used in 2015 by a hacker who posted the stunning details of over four million users with Adult Friend Finder accounts, including personal information and sexual preferences. Only some months after the information was dumped on Hell, the website was exposed, leading to the closing of Hell and the disappearance of the website’s founder, known as Ping. However, after several months of speculation, reams of rumors and only vague references online, it seems Hell’s forum is back online and serving the Dark Web once more.

A user going by the nickname of HA has taken over from Ping as the new administrator of the revived site, and visitors will find everything just like it was in the original version. Although there is no date on the posts, it appears that Hell Reloaded went live a little over a week ago. But not everyone is happy about the return of the hacking forum; many users are understandably cautious, assuming that its rebirth could potentially be a front used by law authorities to locate and apprehend existing and new users. Since Ping has remained absent from the forum, it is difficult to gauge who is behind the re-launch.

Hell is an infamous online portal serving the Dark Web where hackers from all over the world share their tricks and download as well as post stolen data. One of the biggest portals of its kind on the Dark Web, it is frequently used by hackers globally. Now that it has resurfaced, it remains to be seen how hackers and other users will react to it. However, those interested may access the site using the Hell URL as they did in the past.
