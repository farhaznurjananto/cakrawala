I work in the public sector, as do many IWW members in the UK. Historically, this has been a high-unionized area, particularly in education, the civil service, and health care. It is also one of the trade union movement's last bastions of collective bargaining power. Although, as evidenced by recent capitulation to austerity policies, pay cuts, and cuts to social services, trade union density rarely equals trade union militancy. Membership in a craft union in addition to the IWW is a relatively new strategy in the UK. Despite a reputation for "minority unionism," Wobblies have historically played animating roles in trade unions, in addition to their commitment to constructing a combative and revolutionary alternative to crafting union structures. After all, the IWW was formed by combining the most militant and advanced expressions of the trade union movement at the time. Despite this, it would be overly simplistic to claim that membership in the IWW and activity in a larger trade union are completely compatible. The IWW exists primarily to criticize the limitations of craft unionism and its reformist methods. Many leftists believe that trade unions can be captured and used for revolutionary purposes. In practice, this has frequently meant fielding left-wing leadership slates in union elections. A practice that neither appeals to Wobblies nor has proven particularly effective in shifting trade unions' actual activity. Another common strategy is to incite rank-and-file militancy at the branch level, either through the formation of left caucuses or militant rep networks. This appears to be a more natural approach for a Wobbly to take, promoting the qualities and methods that we see as valuable in syndicalist organising militancy, grassroots activism, bottom-up over top-down, and so on. This approach, however, has limitations. Trade union structure and organization can undermine struggles even at the rank-and-file level. A dual-carder must anticipate and prepare for the possibility that trade union bureaucracies will undermine the work of militant organisers and remove them from positions of influence with the membership if they see them as troublesome or a threat, just as any experienced organiser should prepare strategies for dealing with a difficult and divisive boss. Our objectives should go beyond simply organizing more militant and combative labor unions. We need to understand how our activities as trade unionists help to sow the seeds of worker control in our industries, in addition to connecting with those in unorganized sectors and assisting our fellow workers in growing IWW campaigns. I recently had the opportunity to act as a representative for my local NUT (National Union of Teachers) branch; listed below are some observations I made while experimenting with this new role. My hope is that these will contribute to some of the issues raised above as part of a larger debate about dual-carding in the union: 1. Dispelling the myth of the "militant union rep" in charge of building a militant membership It is widely held within trade union branches that reps should do the majority of the legwork. This perception is bolstered by the fact that the majority of union resources, communication, and, most importantly, meetings with management are handled solely through the representative. As a result, coworkers will speak positively or negatively about "bolshie reps" who are capable/incapable of standing up to management on their behalf. This is a weakness in collective strength that a boss can easily exploit to demobilize, distract, or diffuse union activity. Good reps must send the message that it is the membership, not them, who make the decisions. Bringing coworkers into these otherwise exclusive communication channels is a step toward creating a new union culture on this basis. Dual-carders should share rep guides and union resources, meticulously record meetings with management, demonstrate how issues raised have been addressed, and insist that problems be raised collectively through regular branch meetings rather than privately with the rep. Even in recognized workplaces, workers must be educated on the concept that a union is only as strong as its membership, and that a poorly organized union can easily fall into a forum of consultation with management, or even be de-recognized. 2. The branch lacks a social space, so create one. In general, trade union branches are disorganized. This opens up opportunities for dual-carders to introduce more democratic and inclusive processes without encountering much institutional resistance. But in the absence of such clear structures meetings can often just be collective moaning sessions that can be tiring and demobilising for those involved. Of course, people need to let off steam, especially in stressful professions, but this should not come at the expense of collective action. So why not make alternate spaces to do so?
