Open borders lobbyists are increasingly voicing their concerns about the cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials in deporting criminal illegal immigrants. One of their main concerns is the agreements, such as "287(g)", that have been established to allow for tighter collaboration between local police forces and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in order to efficiently detain and deport criminal illegal immigrants.

An advocate for immigrants' rights, Nick Katz, Senior Legal Manager at the pro-immigration organization CASA de Maryland, expressed his concerns during an interview with the Washington Post. He claimed that such agreements have led to increased fear within immigrant communities, as there has been a noticeable rise in immigration raids and racial profiling by ICE. According to Katz, these agreements have created an "extremely destructive" impact on the social fabric of these communities and driven a wedge between police and their Hispanic communities.

Reports from the Washington Post suggest that due to immigration agreements between local and federal officials, foreign-born residents in states like California and New Jersey have become increasingly reluctant to call the police for assistance. They fear that alerting the police to any issue may result in exposing their immigration status, leading to possible detention or deportation.

On the other hand, local police officials in Alabama and North Carolina have stated that these agreements have not impacted the willingness of immigrants to call for assistance. They argue that their deputies do not get involved in immigration matters until someone is arrested, charged and taken to jail.

Open borders activists expressed outrage in January over the termination of lenient immigration enforcement and sanctuary city policies. The shift to more stringent policies led to many local police forces adopting agreements to support ICE in their deportation efforts, which has further alarmed immigrants and their advocates. While there is no clear consensus on the effects of these agreements, it is evident that increased cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE has sparked controversy and concern among certain communities across the United States.
