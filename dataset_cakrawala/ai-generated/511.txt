On Tuesday, Senate Republicans proposed a funding plan that would drastically reduce financial support for women's health programs, including Title X low-income family planning and a crucial evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention program. The proposal follows recent attempts by House Republicans to completely eliminate Title X – the nation's only low-income family planning program.

The proposed spending bill, presented by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services, would result in a 10% budget cut for Title X, amounting to $28.7 million. This would heavily impact the 90% female population – mostly uninsured, young, Black, or Latino individuals – that rely on Title X clinics for birth control, HIV testing, sexually transmitted infection testing, and cancer screenings.

Though the Senate did not propose complete elimination of the program like the House, these substantial cuts could have serious repercussions. It's projected that a 10% budget cut to Title X would result in 82,000 additional unplanned pregnancies next year and would deny 430,000 people access to comprehensive family planning and preventative health services.

The spending bill also proposes an 80% budget reduction for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, which amounts to an $81 million cut for the $101 million program. This proposal contradicts the federal investment in evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention, which has coincided with a 61% decline in the teen birth rate since its peak in the 1990s.

Additionally, the Senate proposal eliminates the Women in Apprenticeships program, significantly cuts other job training initiatives, and removes funding for the Affordable Care Act. This bill has been met with strong opposition from critics, such as Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), who claim that it would "hurt families and communities" and perpetuate the detrimental automatic budget cuts associated with sequestration.
