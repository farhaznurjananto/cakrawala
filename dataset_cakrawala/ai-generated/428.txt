The Cowee Mound is a valuable open field that once served as a vast Cherokee village with a well-preserved history. Kathryn Sampeck, an anthropology professor at Illinois State University, recently returned to the area alongside some volunteers, to continue her archeological study of the region. Sampeck has been working in the area for three years, studying pieces of pottery and iron fragments looking for clues to Cherokee history. Sampeck hopes that each little artifact she finds can add a piece to the larger puzzle of Cherokee civilization’s early history.

Sampeck chose the site as a safer option for her field school students than other alternatives which were not both safe and affordable. After collaborating with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians’ Tribal Historic Preservation Office, the site proved ideal for her purpose since they were happy to have the students study Cowee Mound. Cowee Mound is one of the best-preserved places in the region, thanks to its isolated location. Ben Steere, an anthropology professor at Western Carolina University, explained that invasive archeological digging had led to the ruin of various Cherokee mounds in the past. The new technological advances in archeology make it possible to investigate the past at the site without intruding on the consecrated cultural site.

Michael Seibert, an archeologist for the National Park Service was on hand to provide the volunteers with the knowledge required to operate the three pieces of equipment they used in determining the most likely locations to find important historical artifacts on the site. The team used a ground-penetrating radar to detect irregularities up to 3 feet underground, and a magnetometer that could detect metallic items buried beneath the ground's surface. They found pieces of slag which proved that the Cherokee had useful metalworking techniques that helped them maintain their life ways even when European influence threatened to diminish their traditions. By objectively researching Cherokee history in a respectful and ethical way, Sampeck and her team are learning remarkable things about how the Cherokee interacted with the white culture, perceived others, and even their views on technology.

Sampeck’s studies will continue for years to come. She uses the information she gathers to give lectures at the Cherokee Archeology Conference and provide teaching materials for her department's curriculum. The significance of studying history cannot be overstated, and Sampeck's work provides critical insights into our past. She hopes to help uncover the nuances of this village, its changes and how Cherokee relations were affected by others moving into the area.
