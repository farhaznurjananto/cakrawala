Israel and Turkey have announced that they are restoring full diplomatic relations after six years of tensions between the two countries. The relationship soured after the Mavi Marmara incident in which the Israelis stormed a Turkish-owned ferry to prevent it from running its naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, killing eight Turks and a Turkish-American. Turkey accused Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza. The ties were further damaged by Erdogan's criticism of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians. Although there were hopes that the two sides would reconcile following President Barack Obama's visit to Israel in March 2013, neither side seemed particularly interested in patching up their differences. Over the years, there have been episodic rumours and press reports claiming that a rapprochement was imminent, but neither the foreign ministry nor the leaders seemed able to make it happen. The restored relations have come about for a few key reasons.

First, the coming gas bonanza in the Eastern Mediterranean has prompted negotiations to find a solution to the Cyprus problem and reunify the island, which Israel is expected to benefit from. Cyprus has a lot of natural gas, and Israel has even more. Increased cooperation between Israel and Turkey in this area is therefore desirable.

Second, Turkey's attempt to lead the Middle East after the Arab uprisings has been a dismal failure, with Ankara having poor relations with major capitals in the region like Riyadh, Cairo, and Jerusalem. Ankara therefore has a strong interest in restoring full diplomatic relations with Israel.

Finally, several bone-headed moves by Ankara in relation to Syria, particularly its failure to handle the refugee crisis and opposition to the US-led coalition to combat ISIS, have led to further isolation. What has driven Turkey back to Israel is its fear of an independent or autonomous Kurdish state, especially in Syria. Israel has always sought to maintain close ties with non-Arab groups and countries in the Middle East, including the Kurds. In the past, the Israelis supported Kurdish independence in Iraq, which was disconcerting for Turkey. However, given the AKP's close ties with Masoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, Israel's position on Kurdish independence may no longer be as much of a concern for Turkey.
