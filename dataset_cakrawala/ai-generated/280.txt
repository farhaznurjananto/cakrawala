Republican senators Orrin Hatch and Lamar Alexander reintroduced legislation on Tuesday that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. The individual mandate enforces the requirement that individuals obtain health insurance, and it was upheld as constitutional by the US Supreme Court in 2012.

Hatch stated that the objective of their legislation is straightforward; it will strike the individual mandate and find ways to provide health care to people in a manner that is not in contravention of the constitutional framework of limited government.

The senator's move is being closely watched as it has raised many questions, particularly as to why Hatch is supporting the legislation when he has just won his reelection and does not face any significant Republican challengers. Alexander, on the other hand, is up for reelection in 2014, and it is evident that he is looking to stave off the extremists with this move. 

This reintroduced legislation has left many people skeptical, including the opposition, who argue that it demonstrates the extreme views of the 'teabagger beast' agenda. The ideology behind the legislation is very debatable, as many people are criticizing it for not aligning with the purpose of the Affordable Care Act, which is intended to better the American public's health care. 

It remains to be seen what will become of this legislation, and whether there will be enough support to pass it into law. Hatch and Alexander have shown little regard for the healthcare act's stance, and their move could face significant opposition from other lawmakers. The legislation's future is still uncertain, and many are closely monitoring its progress in the coming months.

In conclusion, Hatch and Alexander's reintroduced legislation presents a contentious issue that has split lawmakers into divided camps. While they are committed to repealing individual mandates, many people are questioning the merit of their movement and the impact it could have on the US healthcare system. The importance of balancing the constitutional boundaries of limited government and providing quality healthcare to the American public is a topic that will continue to be discussed and debated for the foreseeable future.
