Plans for a transit-oriented development (TOD) surrounding the Brookhaven MARTA station in Atlanta began to take shape in 2014. The development would consist of apartments, an office building, a hotel, and civic spaces connected by a public park and the rail station. The development would have also marked an important milestone towards creating more pedestrian-centric developments while catering to the growing demand for density-dependent rail transit in the affluent northern neighborhoods of Atlanta's Brookhaven.

However, the development faced stiff opposition from the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) crowd. Concerns over density, traffic, and the impact on neighboring properties resulted in the Brookhaven City Council repeatedly deferring approval of the site's rezoning request. As a result, MARTA pushed the final decision to the following year to address some of the concerns raised.

Since then, the project has run into more problems. Concerned parties have requested that tax abatements should not be granted to support the development, thereby refusing to give it a chance to materialize. Members of the Brookhaven City Council are reluctant to honor the tax breaks the developer was promised, further derailing the project. The tension has only added to the grief for MARTA, who is already working on other TODs in the city.

Despite these setbacks, proponents of the project argue that affordable housing and new amenities brought by the TOD would foster growth, raise property values, and convert overused parking lots into revenue-generating properties while enriching the city's tax base. Altogether, the project could claim up to $26 million in tax abatements.

However, the city has already granted $36 million in a similar concession earlier this year to the Atlanta Hawks for their new practice facility, which is only a few miles from the MARTA site. Unfortunately, those who hoped that Brookhaven would set the tone for future TODs in Atlanta will have to wait as the project lingers in a bitter struggle.
