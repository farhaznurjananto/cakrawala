 Magic Kingdom's new  restaurant, The Jungle Navigation Co., officially opened today at Adventureland. Ltd. Skipper Canteen. The restaurant is known as the dining room and meeting place of jungle cruise captains and is home to  "World Famous Jungle Cuisine". 
 
 Of particular interest to Disney fans is that this place does not take reservations and is strictly walkable. It is the first Walt Disney World table service restaurant where guests cannot make reservations. Reservations for nearby restaurants can be made 180 days in advance. This is currently  classified as a test, so it's possible that Disney may consider implementing it in other locations as well, or possibly have future reservations. 
 The restaurant podium opens at 10:30 am and guests should arrive when their meal is ready. You cannot reserve a table for a later date. Upon check-in, guests  receive an estimated wait time and  receive a text message when their table is ready. 
  The Disney Meal Plan is adopted and restaurants are required to qualify for one table. Table discounts at Wonderland  are currently not available.
