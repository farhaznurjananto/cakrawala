Visiting Marakech with actresses Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore, who star in the new film, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Mira Nair told a packed news conference that the film is about “the conflict between the East and the West.”

“It is not about Islamophobia. It is about the choice that every human being has to make in life. It is about a young man who has to choose between the promise of the West and the lure of home,” she said.

The film, based on the novel of the same name by Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, was screened at the opening of the festival which runs through Nov. 10.

Streep and Moore play an American couple who travel to Morocco to visit Moore’s aging parents. Moore’s character becomes entranced with the country and its people, while Streep’s character begins to sense that her parents may be losing their grip on reality.

Nair said she was drawn to the story because it is “about people who are struggling to find themselves. It is about love and loss.”

The film has been criticized by some Muslims in the United States as being anti-Muslim.

Nair said she was not worried about the reaction the film would get in the United States.

“The Reluctant Fundamentalist is not a film about Islam. It is a film about people,” she said.

Nair also said she was not worried about Islamic protesters who have taken to the streets of some Middle Eastern countries to express their opposition to the film.

“I am not concerned about Islamic protesters,” she said. “I am concerned about Islamic terrorists.”

She added: “I respect people’s right to protest. But I also respect their right to watch the film.”

The Reluctant Fundamentalist is set for release in the United States on Nov. 24.
