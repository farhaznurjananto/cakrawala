 The contrast between (a) how Paul Ryan is depicted by worshipful Republicans and media figures alike -- as a principled fiscal conservative and advocate of Randian self-sufficiency -- and the reality of what he's done in his life is as stark as it is typical. The American Right has an amazing ability to lionize leaders whose lives are the precise antithesis of the political values that define their image.  
 For the last decade, conservatives transformed George Bush and Dick Cheney into the embodiments of warrior courage, even though they both scampered away from combat, letting others fight and die for them in a war they both supported. The same is true of almost every leading right-wing super-patriot tough-guy: John Bolton, Bill Kristol, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh -- and Mitt Romney. Somehow, when the authoritarians on the Right search for icons of manly warrior power to venerate, they find only those who like to melodramatically play-act as such, but who ran away when it came time to actually perform. In fact, such characters are dressed in highly ornate decorations of contrived Fortitude for the same reason that female copycats have long favored overly feminine outfits and flashy makeup. 
 So we have Paul Ryan, the Landian superhero, a fighter for personal confidence and the working class against public debt, waste, and meddling.
