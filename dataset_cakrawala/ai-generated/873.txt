The original 1996 Crash Bandicoot included a level that was so difficult that developer Naughty Dog deemed it unfit for human consumption. Stormy Ascent, that level, has finally been discovered and released as free DLC for Vicarious Visions' recent remake Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy. Stormy Ascent is free in Europe and North America until August 19th. After that, at least in North America, it will be $2.99. Stormy Ascent is approximately four times larger than any other Crash Bandicoot level. Taylor Kurosaki, the original stage's level designer, reflected on Stormy Ascent in an interview with Vicarious Visions on the PlayStation Blog. "It was one of the last levels I completed during production, and as we were preparing to deliver our Gold Master to Sony for manufacturing, the decision was made to cut it," he lamented. "It was playable, but far too difficult, and we ran out of time to make it less difficult. It remained on the disc because leaving it was less risky than attempting to remove it." Eventually people found it using Gameshark, but it was never part of the game proper. Vicarious Visions wanted to fix this, but remaking it proved difficult because the team was having difficulty completing the level in the first place. "It was challenging to first master the level so that we could accurately remaster it," said N.Sane game director Dan Tanguay. "The level's timing, in particular, was difficult to master. As you progress, the hazards and platforms increase in speed!" Do you want to try Stormy Ascent? Let us know how it goes in the comments.
