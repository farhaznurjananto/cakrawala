Here we go again! Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota Republican Representative who once claimed that the HPV vaccine can turn children into “mental retards” and is a known anti-gay bigot, has done it again. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Bachmann argued that the Obama administration has taken away the First Amendment right to free speech for supporters of traditional marriage.

Said Bachmann:

“[The Obama administration] is using the IRS as a weapon to go after people and organizations that disagree with them. And I say ‘no,’ Mr. President. You will not use the IRS as an attack dog. You will not use the IRS as a weapon to go after those who disagree with you.”

"I say 'no', Mr. President, you will not use the IRS as an attack dog." – @MicheleBachmann

The IRS has been in the news recently after it was revealed that the agency targeted groups with “tea party” in their names. However, Bachmann’s claim that the Obama administration has used the IRS to target marriage equality proponents is bogus. In fact, the IRS has only ever enforced laws against charities that mislead donors about their political activities.

Bachmann has a history of making outrageous statements about HPV, same-sex marriage and the IRS. In 2011, she said that HPV vaccines can “turn children into mental retards.” In 2012, she called the Obama administration’s support of gay marriage a “war on religious liberty.” And in 2013, she said that the IRS is using “coercive tactics” to silence conservative voices.

Bachmann’s conspiracy theories about the IRS and her fear-mongering about HPV vaccines are not only wrong, they are dangerous. Her baseless accusations could scare parents away from getting their children vaccinated against HPV and make it harder for LGBT Americans to live freely and openly. We call on Michele Bachmann to stop spreading false information and conspiracy theories about the Obama administration and the IRS.

Take Action:

Tell Michele Bachmann to stop spreading false information and conspiracy theories about the Obama administration and the IRS.

Demand that Bachmann apologize for her outrageous statements about HPV vaccines, same-sex marriage and the IRS.

Thank you for supporting truth and transparency in politics.
