Tavia/Getty Images Fluffy is horrified by how this study has been reported. This week's news suggests that a recent study discovered your cat wants to kill you. Fortunately for anyone with a feline companion who has access to weapons, those headlines are completely false. The study, led by researchers from the University of Edinburgh, compares the personalities of domestic cats to those of Scottish wildcats, clouded leopards, snow leopards, and African lions, based on assessments made by cat caregivers and zookeepers. Last year, it was published in the Journal of Comparative Psychology. Even lead researcher Marieke Gartner isn't sure why it went viral this week. What she does know is that many news outlets have misrepresented her research. For one thing, she found no evidence that domestic cats want to kill humans. "My research did not suggest this â€” in fact, it's completely unrelated," she wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. "I'm not sure why people say that." But that wasn't the only mistake made by journalists. According to article after article, both domestic cats and lions have prominent personality traits such as "neuroticism," "impulsivity," and "dominance." According to Gartner, this is a misunderstanding of the study. The misunderstanding occurred because Gartner referred to those three characteristics as "personality factors" found in cats and lions. That means that one way to assess the feline's personality is to place the cat on a scale ranging from not very neurotic to very neurotic, or from not very impulsive to very impulsive." In humans, five personality factors are used to describe personality: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism "Gartner stated. "There is a distinction between factors and traits, so no, dominance, impulsivity, and neuroticism are not the most prominent personality traits [in cats and lions]. These are the three personality factors that characterize each species, but each individual will fall somewhere along the spectrum of traits that comprise each personality factor." Mikel Delgado, a certified cat behavior consultant and Ph.D. candidate in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, has some theories about why people love to blame cats for murder. "They don't have as many facial muscles as dogs," she explained to HuffPost. "Their expression is more difficult to read. People often wonder, "What is my cat thinking?"" Cats aren't as big or as dangerous as many dogs, so imagining them wanting to eat us isn't particularly frightening. "We almost find it amusing that cats want to kill us, hate us, or treat us as slaves," Delgado said. People have coexisted with cats for millennia, she added. "Don't you think they would have killed us if they really wanted to?" she asked. The author can be reached at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com. Also on Huffington Post:
