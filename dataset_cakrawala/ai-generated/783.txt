A 15-year-old murder case that placed a popular youngster from Baltimore County in prison for life is being revived simultaneously in a podcast that raises more questions than it answers about the crime and its aftermath and in a Maryland appeals court that will finally decide the man's fate. Millions of listeners eagerly await the new episode of Serial, a podcast from the authors of This American Life that follows the tale of Adnan Syed, a high school student at Woodlawn who was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 2000. Sarah Koenig, a veteran radio producer and former writer for the Baltimore Sun, is the creator of the podcast. She spent more than a year investigating Syed's case and reported her discoveries online every Thursday in nearly real-time. Over the course of nine episodes, the podcast has attracted more than 1.5 million listeners per episode worldwide and turned Syed into a household name, spawning a dedicated fanbase, recap blogs, and even spin-off podcasts, not to mention heated debates over Syed's guilt or innocence at countless water coolers and dinner tables. Yet, despite the recent interest in the case, Syed has been attempting to prove his innocence for years; in fact, his case is now in its last stages of appeal. According to Syed's attorney, C Justin Brown, a hearing slated for January of next year offers the man's "final best shot" for release. "I joke that when I was hired to handle Adnan's appeal, I was an unattached bachelor, but now I am married with two children. Brown, who has represented Syed for over five years, stated that it has been a protracted procedure. "The legal procedure consists of three parts: the trial, the appeal, and post-conviction remedy. This concludes the process." Syed, now 34 years old, was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, and false imprisonment and given a life sentence. Authorities alleged that Syed murdered Lee because he became inconsolably jealous when the two split up and she began dating another man. There were no eyewitnesses linking Syed to the crime, and Syed's attorney, Cristina Gutierrez, refused to examine a witness who claimed she was with Syed at the time Lee was murdered. These are the same reasons Koenig cited in the first episode of her podcast for deciding to explore the case. Gutierrez, a prominent criminal defense attorney in the Baltimore area, was disbarred in 2001 when client monies went missing. In 2004, she died of a heart attack. Brown claims in his appeal that Gutierrez was aware of Syed's classmate Asia McClain, who saw him in the library around the time prosecutors say Lin was murdered. Brown argues that the attorney failed to investigate her alibi during the trial. Brown stated, "the entire trial hinged on whether Syed could demonstrate where he was at the time of the murder." "Meanwhile, a reliable witness, an honors student with no clear bias toward Syed, came forward unasked with a recollection of being with Syed around the time of the murder." Yet, the attorney did absolutely nothing." Brown also found that Gutierrez erred when she did not pursue a plea bargain for Syed, who repeatedly inquired whether a deal was possible. In September, the Maryland court of special appeals invited prosecutors to respond to the post-conviction appeal to see if they, too, believed Syed had poor counsel, a highly unusual move, according to Brown. Despite the fact that millions of listeners are attempting to interpret the evidence for themselves, the ultimate decision rests with the judges. Brown remarked, "This is a rare occurrence." "The court of special appeals has taken an interest in the matter and requested the state to answer to our application, which is more than they typically do at this procedural stage." Nonetheless, I firmly believe that appellate courts base their decisions on the merits of the case, not the popularity of a podcast."
