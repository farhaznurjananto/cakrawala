The team of Bulgarian archaeologist Elena Kisyakova has found traces of an ancient settlement near the village of Lyubimets, Plovdiv Region.

The excavation at the site, which is located in the area of the so called Lyubimets Plateau, started at the end of 2014 and has uncovered the foundations of three buildings, a defensive wall, and a water reservoir.

The settlement near Lyubimets was first mentioned in a deed from the Ottoman archives from 1518.

The three buildings which have been unearthed so far have been associated with the remains of a large structure from the Late Antiquity (4th-6th centuries AD), believed to have been a fortress, and an earlier settlement from the Early Bronze Age (4th millennium BC).

The water reservoir is 4 meters deep, and according to Kisyakova, it was used for collecting water. “This is a new type of water reservoir [for the region],” she has told Radio Focus Plovdiv.

“The defensive wall is 2.3 meters [in width],” she specifies.

The Bulgarian archaeologist has also pointed out that the three buildings are not related to each other. 
“The first building was probably a residential building, the second was probably a storage building, and the third was probably a military building,” she has said.

The settlement near Lyubimets is one of the largest Late Antiquity settlements to be found in the Plovdiv Region so far.

The Plovdiv Region is one of the most important archaeological regions in Bulgaria, and it has a rich history, with traces of prehistoric, ancient, and medieval settlements.

The region is home to some of the most important archaeological sites in Bulgaria, including the Thracian and Roman sites of Asparuhovo, the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages settlements of Philippi and Tsarevo, and the medieval and Ottoman settlements of Plovdiv and Chiprovtsi.

The archaeological excavations in the Plovdiv Region are financed by the Bulgarian Ministry of Culture.
