Mass Effect Andromeda is an enormous open world action RPG with a wealth of missions and side quests to explore.

The first thing you'll notice about Andromeda is its sheer size. The game's map is absolutely massive, and it's crammed full of things to do. There are main missions to progress the story, side missions to undertake, and a whole host of other activities to keep you busy. You can explore planets, search for collectibles, take part in races, and much more.

Andromeda is also packed with loot. You'll find new weapons and armour to equip, and there are plenty of crafting materials to collect. You can use these materials to upgrade your gear, and you can also use them to build new weapons and armour from scratch.

The combat in Andromeda is excellent. It's fast-paced and action-packed, and there's a healthy mix of gunplay and melee combat. You can also use biotics and tech abilities to give yourself an edge in battle.

Andromeda is a massive game, and it's crammed full of things to do. If you're looking for an action-packed RPG with plenty of exploration, then Andromeda is definitely worth checking out. It's available now on PC and Xbox One.
