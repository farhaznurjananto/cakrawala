Premier Kathleen Wynne was coy Wednesday about the future of Hydro One, but said the government will look at ways to keep the provincially owned utility “accountable” to consumers.

“We are not going to sell Hydro One,” Wynne told reporters after a meeting with carmakers in Oakville. “We’re not going to privatize Hydro One. But we are going to look at the governance structure to make sure it is accountable to the people of Ontario.”

Her remarks came on the same day the Progressive Conservatives tabled a private member’s bill calling for the utility to be returned to public hands.

The New Democrats, who are also opposed to the sale of any part of Hydro One, put forward a motion that calls on the government to review the governance of the utility.

Both Opposition parties are upset that Wynne’s government has appointed a “hydro czar” to oversee the sale of 60 per cent of Hydro One, which is expected to raise $9 billion.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she would support the Tories’ bill to bring Hydro One back under public control.

“The fact is, the Liberals are selling Hydro One,” Horwath said.

“Kathleen Wynne needs to stop playing games and come clean with the people of Ontario about her plans for Hydro One.”

The premier said the government is still working on a business case for the sale of Hydro One and hasn’t made a final decision.

“We’re still doing our due diligence and we haven’t made a final decision,” Wynne said.

“There are a lot of different options on the table and we’re going to take the time to make the right decision for the people of Ontario.”

Wynne also said she is open to selling Hydro One’s generation assets, but said she wants to make sure the proceeds from the sale go back into the utility.

“We are looking at all of the options,” she said.

Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown said the Liberals are trying to “conceal their true intentions” with their Hydro One plans.

“They’re trying to bury the bill, but we’re going to keep fighting for the people of Ontario,” Brown
