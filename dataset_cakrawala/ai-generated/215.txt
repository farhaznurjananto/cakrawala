According to recently released federal data, the value of a dollar is not equal across the United States. A nonprofit organization called the Tax Foundation produced a map showing the discrepancies in the value of money across states. However, the real value of money is strongly connected to the Regional Price Parities measure. This tool is a way of measuring the different values of goods and purchasing power from state to state. 
 
Surprisingly, a dollar can buy the most in Mississippi, where prices generally are about 13 percent below the national average, and can buy the least in DC and Hawaii, where prices are respectively nearly 18 percent and just over 16 percent above the national average. The map created by the Tax Foundation relied heavily upon the regional price parity measure. States such as Mississippi have a more advantageous ratio compared to other states, meaning that the price of several goods and services is cheaper. 

When factoring in this measure, it is possible to realize that policies carry a different weight in states such as Nebraska and Arkansas. Although the per capita income between the two is almost the same, the relative purchasing power offered by living in a state like Nebraska stands as an advantage. 

With that said, let us take the example of Alaska and Arkansas and their respective minimum wages. Currently, Arkansans earn the minimum wage of $8 an hour, whereas Alaskans welcome a minimum wage of $9. 75 an hour. The difference of $1.75 might seem significant, but it is important to consider the relative purchasing power of the states. Despite the more progressive minimum wage in Alaska, the value of a dollar is nearly 80% higher in Arkansas. Therefore, the minimum wage in Arkansas equates to almost $8 in Alaska, practically equalizing any discrepancy in wages.
