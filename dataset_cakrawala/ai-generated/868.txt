The APA's Education Directorate tells the chairs of graduate psychology departments about the annual Graduate Study in Psychology effort early each year. The survey link is sent to the chairs the following month. After this first email, there are three more contacts. When a program fills out the survey, APA gets an email about it. Programs are removed from the database if they haven't changed their information for two years in a row. Caveats When using the information in this report, readers should know that there could be mistakes. The subset of departments that took part in the survey is used for analysis, not the whole population. Also, some information was gathered at the level of the department and some at the level of the program. Please keep this in mind when you read tables. Master's programs can be in departments that only give master's degrees or departments that only give doctorates. So, information about some master's degree programs would be put in tables that show data about doctoral departments. The amounts of tuition and financial aid given by Canadian departments are given in Canadian dollars. Talking about the results Characteristics of the Faculty In 2007-2008, 572 graduate psychology departments in the U.S. reported a total of 14,186 faculty, while departments in Canada reported a total of 1,782. (Table 1). Sixty-one percent of U.S. teachers worked in public schools, while 39 percent worked in private schools. About 73% of the faculty worked full time, while the rest worked part time. The number of full-time and part-time faculty members in public and private graduate departments was very different, with more full-time faculty in public departments (82% vs. 59%). In
