Imagine setting off for your daily commute, and instead of the usual delays caused by strikes or severe weather, you find yourself delayed by something rather unusual â€“ a stubborn swan waddling along the tracks. This was the reality for the passengers aboard a South West Trains service from Teddington as their journey took a memorable twist.

With the train forced to crawl along for two miles, pulling into Kingston Upon Thames station became a captivating spectacle. Onlookers couldn't resist chuckling and snapping photos as they discovered the true reason behind the delay, which was announced by the train staff.

In a world filled with mundane commutes and standard train delays, this particular incident stood out as a charming and lighthearted episode. It reminded frustrated commuters that sometimes, even in the midst of the daily grind, life can present us with unexpected and humorous surprises.

South West Trains took the situation in stride, later posting a photo on Twitter of the swan being released, and playfully reassuring the public that the swan "did apologise for the delays." The passengers, train staff, and onlookers will certainly remember this unique morning commute for a long time.
