New Harvard Study Confirms Cannabis Makes Men Last Longer In Bed 
A new study from Harvard University confirms what many cannabis smokers have been saying for years: cannabis makes men last longer in bed. The study, which was published in the Harvard Medical School blog, found that men who smoke cannabis have a significantly lower risk of premature ejaculation than those who don’t.

The study, which was conducted by Dr. Michael Eisenberg, looked at the data of over 50,000 men from the National Health and Social Life Survey. The data showed that men who reported smoking cannabis had a 34% lower risk of premature ejaculation than those who didn’t.

This is not the first time that cannabis has been linked to improved sexual performance. A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2014 found that men who used cannabis before sex reported longer lasting erections and increased sexual satisfaction.

So, if you’re looking to improve your sexual performance, it might be worth giving cannabis a try. Just don’t forget to use a condom!

Cannabis and Anxiety

There is a lot of speculation about whether or not cannabis can help treat anxiety disorders, and the answer is that there isn’t a lot of research to support either claim. However, many people believe that cannabis can be a helpful adjunct treatment for anxiety disorders.

Some of the benefits of cannabis for anxiety include:

Reduced stress and anxiety

Reduced inflammation

Reduced pain

Improved sleep

Improved mood

Improved cognitive function

Cannabis has been shown to be a helpful treatment for a variety of conditions, including anxiety disorders. However, there is a lack of rigorous research to support these claims. It is important to discuss cannabis therapy with a qualified healthcare provider before starting treatment.
