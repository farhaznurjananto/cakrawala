A 55-year-old former banker has undergone several surgeries to fulfill her desire to transform completely into a dragon. Eva Tiamat Medusa, formally known as Richard Hernandez, grew up in Texas US, believing he was a woman trapped in a man's body and slowly started his transformation from a man to a woman and eventually into a "human dragon". Tiamat writes on her blog, 'Eva Medusa Tiamat, Transspeciesis Metamorphosis,' "I am the Dragon Lady, A pre-op M2F transgender in the process of morphing into a human dragon, becoming a reptoid as I shed my human skin, physical appearance, and life as a whole leaving my humanness behind and embracing my most natural self awareness as a mythical beast." Tiamat settled on a dragon persona and underwent procedures such as nose modification, tooth extraction, ear removal, and eye coloration in the hopes of looking more like a dragon. She is almost unrecognizable from her 1990 appearance before undergoing procedures such as her full-face tattoo. Tiamat, who lives in New Mexico, got her name from a video game dragon and has had a forked tongue, horns implanted on her forehead, and the whites of her eyes stained green. She recently had another operation in which both of her ears were cut back. Tiamet has 95% of his body covered in snake scale tattoos and prefers to be addressed as "rather than "he or she." I've been telling people not to judge a book by its cover since the beginning of my transformation journey, but why not? This book cover is stunning in my opinion "Tiamet wrote next to her photo on Facebook.
