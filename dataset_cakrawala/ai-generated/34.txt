Firearms WIP A RWBY lore-fic By A.R.

Aura was a force to be reckoned with. It was the manifestation of a person's soul, and as such, was incredibly powerful. It was also very dangerous. Aura was the source of a person's strength, speed, durability, and other physical abilities. It was also the source of their Semblance.

He had created machines that could shoot arrows and move on their own. He had created weapons that could cut through anything.

And he had even created things that could defy gravity.

None of it was easy.

It was dangerous.

But that was why it was so exciting.

Because forgers were never safe. They were always on the edge of danger, waiting to fall into the abyss that was their own power.

But that was also why they were
