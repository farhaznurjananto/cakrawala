Thousands of people marched in Tel Aviv to promote human rights, carrying posters advocating for "racism-free elections" and calling for a true revolution to start from the bottom. The march began at the Habima National Theatre and concluded at Rabin Square, where artists performed to mark International Human Rights Day. The event was the fourth annual rally to campaign for basic rights for everyone.
 
This year's rally saw many demonstrators directing criticism towards Israel's leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, for suppressing civil liberties. Speakers who addressed the crowd lamented the lack of political freedom and impunity for human rights violators on the nation's political landscape.

Many of the demonstrators were women from the Arab community, who have long suffered from a high rate of unemployment. According to Waffa Tiara of the Maan Workers Advice Center, over 80% of Arab women are unemployed, an issue the government has failed to address, denying them their right to work. At the rally, Tiara told reporters that attending the march was important for her to represent Arab women, whose rights are violated repeatedly. Tiara helps women find work, and she believes that employment is a fundamental right that the government has consistently ignored. 

Dawit Demoz, an Eritrean asylum seeker, was also among the protesters, joining the marchers despite the tense situation for asylum seekers in Israel. The Israeli government regards asylum seekers as illegal infiltrators, often treating them like criminals. Demoz entered Israel by jumping the southern border three years ago, and since then, he's been fighting for his basic rights. For Demoz, the march was an opportunity for members of underrepresented communities to unite in their battle for equality and protest against the violation of their human rights. He called on Israelis to recognise that Eritreans and other underrepresented communities are fighting for their lives against brutal dictatorships. 

Despite the diverse backgrounds of the demonstrators, organisers made a point of choosing performers who represented different segments of Israeli society, from religious to ethnic groups. The president of the Association for Civil Rights, Sami Michael, shared his thoughts on the event's overall message, emphasising that art should be part of the struggle for everyone's rights: "Art at its best touches all our hearts and reminds us that we all belong to the same noble and sensitive race â€“ the human race, which deserves rights to the fullest extent." 

Zahava Gal-On, Chairwoman of the Meretz Party, spoke of the persecution of people and groups fighting for civil rights, but was optimistic that the fight would continue despite tough times. "Unfortunately, the next Knesset doesn't look more promising than the current one, but we won't give up," she declared. "We will fight against the fascism and racism that rear their heads at the Knesset and the Israeli society and will stand guard over democracy". 

The human rights rally clearly showed that there is a need for substantive changes in Israeli politics. However, it also reaffirmed the value of a united front, with people from various backgrounds coming together to support each other in their fight for genuine democracy and human rights.
