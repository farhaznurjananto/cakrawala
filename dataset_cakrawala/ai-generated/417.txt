The Rise of Military Rule 2.0 

Since the end of the Cold War, democracy promotion has taken center stage in US foreign policy, making military dictatorship less acceptable. This shift in US foreign policy puts military regimes in a difficult position as they must adapt to a world where foreign investment is important, and new forms of communication have made it harder to install a servile prime minister and crack down on the populace. Instead, today's military regimes find it easier to function as kingmakers rather than kings, while still pretending to be neutral in politics. They walk a fine line by using their influence, in the background, to keep governments in power, or topple them. At other times, the military uses its expertise in handling dangerous security threats like drug trafficking or terrorism to build up its power again. 

From 1950 to 1990, there were many coups or coup attempts worldwide, but since the 1990s, violent military takeovers have dropped in number, and there have only been eight coups since 2005. However, military leaders are increasingly controlling governments from behind the scenes, which is a new and disturbing trend throughout the developing world. 

For decades, developing countries have experienced military takeovers that were quite obvious, with the entire government taken over and an appointed servile leader. But now, military regimes are more subtle in their control, dominating law enforcement and other civilian institutions from behind the scenes. For example, in several Mexican states, the military essentially commands the area, still maintaining its fiction of neutrality in politics. 

Nowadays, major developing countries have become more dependent on trade and need far more sophisticated economic management than what a few generals can provide. Following a wave of anti-Thaksin protests in Bangkok in 2006, the Thai military took over, forcing Thaksin out. But the army soon ran into setbacks. Its installed prime minister appeared to have little idea about how to manage Thailand's complex and globalized economy, which frightened off foreign investors and created a run on the stock market. 

Whichever way one looks at it, military rule is dangerous as armies can commit abuses without consequence, dragging down developing democracies that seemed to be beyond the era of military influence. In this manner, military men make themselves indispensable to foreign partners like the United States by presenting themselves as the only institutions with long-term stability. This undermines civilian leaders, who struggle to maintain their image of a stable government while simultaneously facing the military's control of various sectors of civil society. 

In conclusion, while militaries can still effectively rule small, very poor nations, they no longer have a free pass to control larger and more stable countries as the world's developing nations further integrate into the global economy. Yet, while the world is now less accepting of coups and putting more emphasis on democracy, militaries are not disappearing. Instead, they are becoming more sophisticated in their use of power, becoming kingmakers rather than overtly controlling governments.
