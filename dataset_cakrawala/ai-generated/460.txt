Democrats are gearing up to make President Trump's Supreme Court nominee face a challenging confirmation process, regardless of who the candidate turns out to be. Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has made it clear that if the nominee isn't President Obama's earlier pick, Judge Merrick Garland, he will filibuster. In taking this stance, Merkley argued that the seat has been "stolen," and that he and his Democratic colleagues intend to "use every lever in our power to stop this."

This confrontational approach by the Democrats contrasts sharply with the treatment Republican senators offered to Obama's nominations of far-left District Court Judges Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Despite their ideological differences, Republicans allowed both nominees to have polite hearings and eventually confirmed them. The Democrats' current level of opposition suggests a preference for partisan conflict over bipartisan cooperation.

Democrats may have set themselves up for a lack of bipartisan support when President Obama, for example, nominated Timothy Geithner as Treasury Secretary. Despite having limited experience and questions surrounding his tax compliance, Republicans permitted his nomination to advance to the floor for a vote. More recently, two of President Trump's nominees, Dr. Tom Price for Health and Human Services secretary, and Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, faced stalling tactics as Democrats literally did not show up for the scheduled vote, preventing the formation of a quorum and hindering the confirmation process. These instances highlight the apparent double standard at play, which could impact future cooperation between the two parties.

Despite their complaints about the lack of bipartisanship in government, Democrats seem to be uninterested in compromise, as evidenced by their tactics against President Trump's nominees. It appears they prefer engaging in parliamentary sabotage, aiming to weaken the president just weeks into his first term. They seemingly hope that political chaos will provide a path back to power.

However, Democrats may face unforeseen consequences for their actions. When Harry Reid was Senate Majority Leader, he ended the filibuster for federal judges, a decision many Democrats celebrated. The current Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, may decide to similarly end the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees. If that were to happen, Democrats would have no one to blame but themselves for the weakened position in which they found themselves.

In conclusion, the Democrats' confrontational approach toward President Trump's Supreme Court nominee could hinder any chances for bipartisan cooperation in the future. Their tactics may also lead to a further weakening of their position in the Senate, particularly if the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees is ended. As the political climate continues to be defined by division and partisanship, politicians should remember the importance of working together to achieve the best outcomes for the country as a whole.
