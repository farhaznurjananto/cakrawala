Mauricio Soler, the famous Colombian climber, who gained recognition in the 2007 Tour de France, announced his retirement from professional cycling after a freak accident in the 2011 Tour de Suisse. Soler suffered a fractured skull and was placed in an induced coma after the crash. His retirement date was less than a year ago, and he still struggles with the fact his career was cut short. Soler won a mountain stage at the Tour de France in his first season riding for Barloworld in 2007, making him the third Colombian and the first since Santiago Botero's win in 2000 to be crowned the Tour's best climber. His success helped revive Colombian cycling once again. 

Less than a year since his retirement, he realizes how challenging it has been to come to terms with his forced retirement. After the crash, Soler was informed by a neurologist that he would likely not be able to return to cycling competitively, and this was hard for him to digest. He recalls that, sometimes, even if you are at your peak, a fall or an illness can put an end to a remarkable career. 

Soler still enjoys watching cycling on television, especially the significant races like the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. He, however, cannot watch live action, as it takes him back to a career he misses. The memories of his triumphs and achievements, which concluded with an emotional stage win at the Tour de Suisse, are now kept safely in his head after losing nearly all his personal footage. 

Notably, Soler misses the cycling lifestyle and routine, even though he suffers from dizziness and headaches whenever he pushes himself too far. Now cycling as therapy, he rarely engages in the sport and instead spends his time walking around his property, something he previously did to train for competitions. He notes that his body became used to spending lots of energy, and it is not easy to do anything beyond walking. His recovery phase is now more focused on family time and his son, who is his biggest supporter. 

In conclusion, Soler's remarkable career ended abruptly, but he still holds onto the memories of his past achievements. Though he finds it difficult to come to terms with his forced retirement, he has adjusted his way of life to remain positive and enjoys spending time with his family.
