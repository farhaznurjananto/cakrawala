Yesterday Your Mama worked out a deal with my new agent, the totally awesome and amazing John Deagle (who also represents Your Mama) and we are now the newest members of his client list.

I am very excited about this new arrangement. Mr. Deagle is a hard-working, no bullshit kind of guy that doesn’t like drama and that is just the kind of agent Your Mama needs.

Your Mama has been with the same talent agency for over a decade. We’ve had some great times and some not so great times and though we’ve been through some rocky patches in the past, Your Mama and our agency have always managed to stick it out. Over the past few years, we’ve been very unhappy with the direction our agency has been going and we’ve been actively looking for a way out.

We had a few meetings with some other agents but nothing felt quite right. Then we had a meeting with Mr. Deagle and it was immediately clear that he was the agent for us.

We are very excited about this new chapter in our career and we are looking forward to working with Mr. Deagle to take Your Mama to the next level.

Sincerely,

Your Mama’s Manager

P.S. I’ll keep you updated on all the exciting things that are happening!
