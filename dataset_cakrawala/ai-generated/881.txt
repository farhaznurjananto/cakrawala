The most successful bitcoin brokerage in the world is establishing operations in the United Kingdom! Bitcoiniacs and Cointrader.net, the Canadian companies that introduced the first Bitcoin ATM to the world, are quietly replicating their Vancouver business abroad. Last month, a partnership was established in Singapore, followed by a joint venture in London. The Bitcoiniacs and Cointrader.net management team partnered with the UK Company QuickBitcoin to install a Bitcoin ATM within the renowned e-cig and coffee shop The Vape Lab, located just a few steps from Liverpool Street station. Pierre Durand and Jonathan Cadeilhan state, "We are ecstatic to welcome the first bitcoin ATM in the United Kingdom into our store. We will continue to make every effort to keep The Vape Lab at the forefront of innovation and creativity." The process of buying and selling bitcoin in the United Kingdom has become much simpler, according to Mitchell Demeter. We now offer our clients four distinct trading options. The new company, operating as Cointrader UK, has brought the full package: customers can use the ATM, they can make an appointment to buy or sell in person, they can buy or sell small amounts online at quickbitcoin.co.uk, or they can fund their account and trade online at Cointrader.net. Additionally, they will host weekly information sessions at The Vape Lab to assist new users in comprehending the fundamentals of this new technology. The Bitcoin community in London is rapidly expanding as entrepreneurs from all over the world create businesses centered on this new currency. This is the third Bitcoin ATM in the city, but the first Bitcoin company to offer multiple trading options and information sessions. Cointrader UK invites everyone to come celebrate the official kick off of their European business on Tuesday, April 22nd at The Vape Lab located at 232 Shoreditch High Street between 4-10pm. â€” Hugh Halford-Thompson is a UK coin dealer.
