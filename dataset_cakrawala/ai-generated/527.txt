Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has expressed concerns over the rise of crowdfunding in India, as investors aim to discover the next Alibaba or Facebook. Crowdfunding is attracting increasing attention in the country; however, Rajan has warned that as this method of raising capital gains traction, it could lead to regulatory challenges and issues with fund recovery if and when businesses fail. 

During the State Bank of India Banking and Economics Conclave, Rajan shared his concerns, stating, "One of my worries about crowdfunding is when it works, itâ€™s good, but when you have to recover (the important questions are) who recovers and how does it happen, especially in an environment where enforcement is difficult." 

Crowdfunding is currently defined by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as the collection of funds from multiple investors through web-based platforms for specific creative projects, business ventures, or social causes. The challenge, however, lies in how crowdfunding is conducted, with regulators voicing concerns over the lack of protection and safeguards for retail investors. 

While investments backed by venture capitalists or private equity are protected within a company's management and board, this level of security is absent for retail investors participating in crowdfunding. Instances of defaults, frauds, and lack of documentation leave these investors vulnerable, with virtually no means of recovering their money if the funding platform suddenly closes down. Notable Indian crowdfunding platforms include TheHot-Start.com, Indiegogo.com, and wishberry.in.
