India's government think tank NITI Aayog has recommended that the country's national carrier, Air India, should not be privatised until it has been unbundled from its real estate assets. The debt-laden airline, which holds a 14% domestic market share, has been struggling under the weight of approximately INR50,000 crore ($7.7bn) in accumulated debt.

Air India operates in both the domestic and international markets, and is reportedly considering privatisation as a solution to offload its mounting debt. In light of the airline's current financial situation, the NITI Aayog's proposal advised separating the airline's operations from its considerable real estate holdings before initiating any privatisation process.

The airline has a fleet of 140 planes and flies to approximately 41 international and 72 domestic destinations. Beyond its aircraft, Air India's assets include vast land holdings, such as nearly 32 acres in central Mumbai, its iconic headquarters on Marine Drive valued at over INR1,600 crore, and properties in various international locations including New Delhi, London, Hong Kong, Nairobi, Japan, and Mauritius.

The NITI Aayogâ€™s proposal recommends hiving off these real estate assets into a separate company, with up to 100% equity being offered to a strategic partner. This would create a more attractive opportunity for potential investors and lessen the burden of the divestment process on the Indian government. The Modi-led government has been exploring options to either privatise or sell off the carrier, which has caused a significant drain on the exchequer over the years.

Addressing a press conference recently, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju stated that the government is considering all potential courses of action to make Air India a strong and viable airline. As part of an ongoing financial restructuring plan introduced in 2012, the government has infused equity capital of approximately INR23,993 crore into Air India. Despite this, the airline continues to struggle and reported a loss of around INR3,587 crore in 2015-2016. 

Given the competitive environment in the aviation industry and Air India's uncertain viability, proponents of its privatisation argue that it is not justifiable for taxpayers to continue funding the struggling airline. The NITI Aayog's recommendations aim to provide a more sustainable solution that will ultimately benefit both the government and the airline.
