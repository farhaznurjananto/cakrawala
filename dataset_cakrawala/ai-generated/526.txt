During a recent video conference at the Challenge.rs conference in Barcelona, Edward Snowden called for public support of Apple's commitment to privacy, suggesting that the focus should be on data protection rather than on whether or not Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, is being genuine. Snowden emphasized the significance of Apple directing its business model away from collecting and selling user information, as its competitors do, and towards prioritizing the privacy of its customers.

According to Snowden, Apple's decision to differentiate itself from competitors such as Google is a beneficial move for privacy and has the potential to positively impact the company's reputation. He argues that Apple's commitment to privacy should be encouraged and incentivized, regardless of whether it is an honest pursuit or merely a marketing tactic.

In light of this commitment, Apple has been experimenting with methods to personalize user data while maintaining privacy. For instance, the company has introduced a new Proactive update to Siri, which scans emails for event reminders without sending the data to Apple's servers for processing. This approach demonstrates an effort to provide both convenience and data protection for users, establishing Apple as a leader in the industry.
