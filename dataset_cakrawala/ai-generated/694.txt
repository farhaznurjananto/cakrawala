Title: Seeking Help to Identify a Mysterious Korean Movie

I recently came across a peculiar Korean movie that my teammate, MC, was watching before I left for IEM in China. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to inquire about the title, and finding it on his computer has been impossible, considering he's now in Germany.

From the brief 30-second snippet that I saw, here's what I gathered about the film:

- It's in Korean.
- The storyline revolves around a man who kidnaps several girls, forcing them to stay in a room covered in newspaper wallpaper. The only way for the girls to obtain any necessities or luxuries (food, clothes, etc.) is by having sex with their captor.
- Throughout the movie, the girls develop a combination of Stockholm syndrome and competitiveness, resulting in an accumulation of extravagant items.

Despite the plot resembling that of a Japanese pornographic film, I am determined to discover this movie's title. Having searched extensively through recent Korean films and reached out to the Team Liquid community, I am still at a loss. Google searches have only led me to the well-known Korean film Oldboy.

If anyone has any insights into the name of this elusive film, please share your knowledge.
