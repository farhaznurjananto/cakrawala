Actor Steven Seagal has waded into the debate regarding the ongoing NFL protests, where players kneel during the national anthem. The popular American action-movie star, now a Russian citizen, described the pregame protests as “disgusting,” “outrageous,” and “a joke.” Speaking on “Good Morning Britain,” Seagal accused NFL players who participate in these protests of holding the United States and the world hostage. He claimed that they were imposing their political view on others who are trying to enjoy a football game. 

Seagal has always been known as an unapologetic supporter of the American flag, and he reiterated such support again during the television interview. Not only does he respect the flag and everything it represents, but he has also risked his life for it on multiple occasions. While Seagal believes in free speech, he sympathizes with those who do not approve of the protests during the anthem. 

Seagal’s opinion echoes what the US President, Donald Trump, has been saying in recent times. Trump has been vehemently critical of NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem and has called for them to be fired by the team owners. The President has urged that those who disrespect the American flag be sanctioned. Trump’s comments have led to a rift between him and some NFL players, with many calling Trump’s views divisive and a direct attack on their constitutional right to protest peacefully.

In the interview, Seagal called the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections ridiculous. The actor, who was granted Russian citizenship by Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, downplayed the allegations mentioning that Russia did not possess the technology capable of interfering with the elections. Seagal was clear that he defended Russia against such allegations and that it was unfair to paint Russia in a negative light.

Seagal’s comments mirror those of some NFL players who have been defending their right to protest. They (players) have claimed that they are not protesting the national anthem, nor is their demonstration an insult to the military. They claim that the protest is about police brutality, racial injustice, and inequality in America. NFL protests started in 2016 when then-San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem as a way of protesting against police violence against minorities.

Seagal’s strong stance on this issue, coupled with his controversial comments regarding Russian interference in the US election, might not sit well with critics, and it remains to be seen how the public and media will react to his views. However, Seagal’s opinions on this hot-button issue have become part of a broader national conversation, with free speech and patriotism at its core.
