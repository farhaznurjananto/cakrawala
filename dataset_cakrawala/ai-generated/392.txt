Former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday confirmed fears among Democrats that President Donald Trump may have committed obstruction of justice, but party leaders for the most part are avoiding impeachment talk, at least until the result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian electoral meddling is known. 

Comey's testimony gave some Democrats more confidence that they have a strong case against the president. "Having him, under oath, saying he felt he was directed to drop the investigation into the national security adviser, I do think strengthens that case” for obstruction of justice, Democratic Senator of Delaware Chris Coons acknowledged. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he felt Comey's testimony suggested the White House was increasingly under siege. Meanwhile, California Democratic Representative Adam Schiff noted that this testimony constituted "evidence of an intention to interfere or potentially obstruct at least a portion of the Russia investigation, if not more."

Democrats are avoiding impeachment talk partly because party leaders want to keep the focus on the GOP's Obamacare repeal plan and other pocketbook issues that might help them rebound in the midterms, not a Russia scandal with an uncertain timeline. But the fallout from Comey's testimony has prompted the most senior figures to come out in support of stronger language against the president with respect to the FBI's Russia investigation. 

The Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took the floor after the hearing to say “The cloud hanging over this Administration has just gotten a whole lot darker. President Trump has declared repeatedly that he was not under investigation. He still isn't. But in opening up the possibility that he attempted to obstruct justice needs to be investigated, that is what we'll do. The guiding principle being that we need to follow the facts, wherever they lead.” 

Despite initial calls for Trump's impeachment, Democratic lawmakers are taking a more cautious approach. Senate Judiciary Committee member, Democratic Senator of California, Dianne Feinstein, stated “I’ve been asked questions: Is this collusion? Do you have evidence of collusion? Right now, no. Not what I would call sufficient. Suspicion is one thing — evidence is another.” While Feinstein acknowledges there is sufficient suspicion to warrant further investigation, it remains unclear whether the situation will meet the legal standard.

For the moment, the aim for most Democrats is to allow Mueller to conduct his investigation, although they also want an independent commission to work alongside him. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said “While Republicans were focused on undermining health care for American families, the American people witnessed a dose of truth from former FBI Director James Comey, delivered under oath in a congressional hearing." 

The full House ultimately impeached former President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, but he was not convicted by the Senate. Only time will tell if the brewing Trump scandal leads to a similar endgame.
