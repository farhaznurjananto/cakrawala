Guwahati: Floods have affected at least 13,000 people in Assam, officials said on Sunday. In addition, landslides caused by heavy rains disrupted rail service to the state's Barak Valley region. According to officials from the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, at least 13,000 people have been affected by the year's first wave of floods in 28 villages in the districts of Lakhimpur, Jorhat, and Biswanath in the last 24 hours. Aside from that, landslides in the hilly Dima Hasao district severed the rail link to Barak Valley. The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) had to cancel a passenger train from Lumding to Silchar on Saturday due to landslides on the hill section. The water level in the Brahmaputra River has been rising and is now flowing above the danger level in Nimatighat, prompting officials to suspend ferry services from Jorhat to the island district of Majuli. Due to the rising water level in the Brahmaputra, ferry services have been suspended in some other stretches as well. The Assam government has already directed officials in flood-prone districts to prepare relief and rescue materials in the event of an emergency. The army and the civil administration also conducted a joint flood rescue exercise called "Megh Rahat" in the Morigaon district's Dharamtul area. The exercise aimed to ensure the collective mutual benefit of all participants, who included army and State Disaster Rescue Force (SDRF) personnel as well as local residents, including schoolchildren.
