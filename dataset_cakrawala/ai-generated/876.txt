Last night, Vice's gaming site, Waypoint, went rogue and posted a statement in light of the recent allegations of sexual harassment at the company detailed in a Daily Beast article published on Wednesday.  
 When we came here, each of us had our own reservations about VICE. We have all, publicly or privately, spoken about our desire to be a force of positive change at VICE, a company which we believe has both a torrid history and a great deal of journalistic excellence. In light of the Daily Beast's story, we have realized how important it is that we not only push for change in private, internal meetings, but that we also must use our platform to publicly hold accountable our own workplace.  
 In addition, Vice's editorial union posted a statement on Twitter:

 It doesn't take a tea-leaf reader to see that these, along with a very odd (and previously unbylined, now attributed to Oliver "Oli" Coleman) Page Six item lightly threatening Shane Smith, plus a lot of rumors I have personally been hearing for WEEKS, portend a big story is on the way, almost certainly in the New York Times, detailing a larger investigation into the company's less than stellar record in the workplace sexual harassment department. "In a time of sexual harassment scandals, Coleman may warn. Vice mogul Shane Smith may regret bragging in a 2003 interview."
