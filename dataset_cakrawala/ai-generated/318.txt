Catholics in Sudbury Claim Winter Storm a Sign from God against Pro-Abortion Extremism

Sudbury, ON, December 21, 2012 – Faithful Catholics in Sudbury are praising divine intervention in their campaign against pro-abortion "extremist" Justin Trudeau. A winter storm caused school buses to be cancelled, leading to significantly fewer people in attendance at St. Charles College High School, where the Liberal Leadership hopeful had been planning to address students.

The board had originally hoped to pack the school's amphitheater with around 1000 students, who would hear Trudeau's views at first hand. However, due to the winter storm, fewer than 100 people were in attendance.

Protestors who were campaigning to prevent Trudeau's visit to the school praised God for limiting his attendance to only around 100 people. Kevin Murphy, a Catholic ratepayer and one of the protestors who stood outside the Board's office and St. Charles College for four days, commented, "God is good. He spared 900 Catholic youth from being potentially influenced by Justin's immoral views in support of abortion and homosexual marriage.”

One of the organizers of the protest, Suresh Dominic, a spokesperson for Campaign Life Catholics, a division of Campaign Life Coalition, expressed their disapproval of the Board's decision to allow Trudeau to speak at the school, but thanked the weather for limiting his exposure. The board had claimed that Justin would not speak on abortion or homosexuality, but Murphy believes that even allowing a politician who has spoken publicly against Catholic teachings to speak before a Catholic audience is tantamount to supporting their views.

Whilst the uproar and protests ensured that only a handful of students heard Justin speak, a news release from Campaign Life Catholics mocked the difficulty faced by the politician in speaking before the coldest day in Sudbury since 1993 as "an act of God." They claimed that their relentless campaign had succeeded in dissuading many from attending Trudeau's speech and undermining his credibility amongst Catholics. Thus, they contended it was only a matter of time before Catholics became “fed up” with politicians who claimed to be Catholic but stood against the teachings of the church.

Although Trudeau still spoke to the few present at the school, the reduced numbers would have been a disappointment to his supporters in Sudbury. However, the weather meant that his comments may have been missed by most Sudburians. Regardless of the irony of the situation, the controversy over the politician's speech has led to increased public discussion on whether politicians should be invited to speak at private schools and whether school authorities should have the power to decide who speaks on their premises, regardless of the audience.
