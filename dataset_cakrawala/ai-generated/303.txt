The Original Pizza Logs - Western New York's very own snack sensation - have come a long way since they were first introduced in a Niagara Falls convenience store. From humble beginnings, the snack has grown into a national brand that is available in shops, restaurants, and large sports arenas across the country. The company has finally announced plans to expand its operations in Niagara County.

To mark the occasion, the family that owns the company and local leaders gathered on Tuesday morning to break ground on a new 30,000 square foot state-of-the-art factory, which will be located in the Niagara County-operated Vantage Point Industrial Park. The new Original Pizza Logs plant will be the final piece needed to complete that park.

During the ceremony, Jason Cordova, the company's owner, expressed his excitement about the new development: "Western New York is a great place to be. We don't want to be anywhere else. This is the place to grow, and I'm from here, and the business is going to stay here."

The new plant is a $3.1 million dollar private investment made possible with the help of several local and state agencies. It is set to open around Thanksgiving 2016 and will create 30 more full-time jobs over the next three years.

Cordova believes that the expansion into the new facility will allow the company to launch exciting new product lines. When asked about the details, Cordova remained tight-lipped, stating that the new products had been beta tested and were "fantastic," but that the public would have to "stay tuned."

The groundbreaking ceremony was a memorable occasion for the Original Pizza Logs company. Cordova's father had started the company decades ago in the back of a Niagara Falls convenience store. Today, the family-run business is a success story for Western New York, and the expansion comes at a crucial time. The new facility will allow the company to grow and continue to innovate for many years to come.
