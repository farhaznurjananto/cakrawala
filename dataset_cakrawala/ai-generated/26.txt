At this stage it will take a miracle for the Crows to even make the eight, let alone play finals and this coach doesn’t look like the messiah.

8. Carlton (4-9)

The Blues were thumped by the Bulldogs, which could be the end of their season. Coach Brendon Bolton said after the game, “It’s not the end of the world, this has happened before to our football club. We’ve got a young group, who are learning how to win.”

2. Melbourne (11-3)

The Demons have been playing some of the best football in the competition and they are in the
