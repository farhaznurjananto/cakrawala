If you thought the Raiders cut Roland McLain was good news, you'll love it. According to Joel Corry of the National Football Post, McLain's contract included language that if he was suspended for conduct, the remaining guaranteed funds would be voided. 
 Last season, he actually got a two-game suspension for behavior that hurt his team. This brings his dead money against Cap to $7.26 million from his previously recognized $10.895 million. If he remained on the list, he would only have $585,000 more than his cap hit in 2013. 
 Essentially, this means that the cost of cutting it is negligible compared to maintaining it. But keeping him around is far more costly to the team dynamics, and you can't put numbers into it. In this case, for Rolando McClain, it was literally the payback period. 
 McClain officially became his free agent  at 1 p.m. Pacific time on Monday, and the Raiders immediately put that $3.635 million to good use. In about 24 hours, they have signed his two outside free agents (CBs Mike Jenkins and S. Usama Young) and re-signed two  free agents (DE Andre Carter and CB Jose Rio Hanson). They are also believed to have advertised deals to  remaining exclusive free agents CB Brandian Ross, RB Jeremy Stewart and OL Alex Parsons.
