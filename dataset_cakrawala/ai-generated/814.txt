(CNN) Two K-9 officers, a detective, and a SWAT team member were among the first Las Vegas police officers to arrive at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on October 1, as Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told 60 Minutes on CBS that specialized training enabled them to respond so swiftly. Lombardo stated, "I believe they prevented a thousand deaths, and I believe it's important for the American public to understand that." Lombardo had traveled to Mumbai, India, after the November 2008 terrorist attacks that killed 164 people at hotels and other locations. According to the sheriff, the department now responds more rapidly to such shootings by forming a team to "cease the action" of the perpetrator. Lombardo stated, "Before, we were trained to form a perimeter and hope for the best." Now that we're trained, we'll gather and go get it.

MUST WATCH Survivors remember bodies, blood in Vegas 02:30 Matthew Donaldson was completing paperwork when radio transmissions reported an active shooter. In the "60 Minutes" interview, he stated that he hopped in his car and drove 9 miles to the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. Donaldson ran the last few blocks to the hotel, he said, but discarded the cowboy boots he wore in the casino because they hurt his feet. "I was faster and would be more effective without shoes," he stated. K-9 officers Dave Newton and Sgt. Joshua Bitsko were conducting dog training nearby when they heard the radio call. "I just yelled 'Let's go!' to these men. There is a shooter on the loose,'" Bitsko recalled saying. They drove to the location. At the hotel, they met Levi Hancock, an explosives-equipped SWAT officer, and zeroed in on the 32nd floor, where other officers had located the shooting. Bitsko believed there may have been multiple shooters. Paddock had already shot Jesus Campos, a Mandalay Bay security officer who had gone to investigate an alarm, in the leg through the door. According to the police, Paddock ceased firing upon the crowd when Campos approached his door. "Hurry, but be still" The team of four discovered that the stairwell door to Paddock's hallway was barricaded. "He had secured the door to the stairwell leading to the hallway directly outside his door with a piece of metal and some screws," Bitsko recalled. Newton stated that the SWAT officer used a pry bar to open the door. The door to Paddock's room down the hall was riddled with bullet holes. "It looked like Swiss cheese," Newton said. Newton explained that a member of the SWAT team set explosives to detonate the door without arousing the shooter's suspicions. Newton recalled saying, "Hurry up, hurry up, but be quiet." They were unaware of Paddock's location in the room. It had been just over an hour since the last shot was fired. Bitsko said it was like a "deadly game of hide and seek." "Man, I wish I had my dog with me because it's nice to have him lead the team," Bitsko said. Someone said on the police radio, "Breach, Breach, Breach." The explosion triggered the alarms. The door was ajar, and the group immediately flooded the room. Inside, the officers discovered drills, other tools, drill bits, cell phones, laptops, firearms, and ammunition. Additionally, they discovered Paddock's body. 'Tripping over guns' Bitsko recalled that the space smelled of gunpowder. He stated, "We were tripping over guns." Authorities recovered 23 guns from Paddock's room, police said. Newton stated that officers also discovered a handwritten note containing calculations of distance and trajectory from the suspect's window to the crowd below. Authorities have received over a thousand tips, but are still unable to determine why Paddock, who had no criminal record, carried out the attack. "He was equipped with toolboxes and power tools for wiring his surveillance system. It took him days to finish everything he had," Bitsko said. Blood drips from my hand. Sunday morning, the FBI searched Paddock's home in Mesquite, Nevada, Mesquite Police Chief Troy Tanner told CNN.
