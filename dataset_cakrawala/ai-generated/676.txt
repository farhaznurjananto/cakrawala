On CBS News' "Face the Nation," Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) expressed doubts about the future of the GOP's Obamacare replacement bill, which has faced resistance within the Senate due to intraparty disagreements. When asked by host John Dickerson about the fate of the health care bill, McCain provided a bleak outlook, admitting that he believed it would fail, but adding that he has been wrong before.

McCain suggested that the debate should involve bipartisan negotiations, even if the Democrats' amendments do not make it into the final version of the bill. He stated, "And then we should convene a Republican conference, say, 'What are we going to do?' Introduce a bill. Say to the Democrats, 'Here's a bill.' It doesn't mean they don't, that they control it. It means they can have amendments considered. And even when they lose, then they're part of the process. That's what democracy is supposed to be all about."

Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) shared McCain's concerns about the bill's survival, telling Fox News' Chris Wallace, "We donâ€™t know what the plan is. Clearly, the draft plan is dead. Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I don't know." The bill has encountered opposition from senators such as Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Susan Collins (Maine), and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). With all 48 Democrats expected to vote against the bill, it will fail to pass if three Republicans also refuse to support it.

Despite these concerns, President Trump expressed optimism about the bill on Twitter, saying that he couldn't "imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new Health Care bill fully approved and ready to go!" However, ten days prior, Trump had tweeted that if the GOP found themselves unable to pass a health care law, they should repeal Obamacare first and worry about a replacement later.
