As Ontario's new pension plan involves significant financial stakes, misinformation is becoming more prevalent, and powerful business interests may rely on public confusion and apathy regarding distant retirements to fuel current panic. It is vital not to allow opposing voices to distort the Ontario Retirement Pension Plan (ORPP) without understanding the facts.

Some critics have labeled the new Ontario pension plan as a "job-killing payroll tax," mirroring the rhetoric of the defeated Stephen Harper government. However, their claims about the pension, which is set to be phased in beginning next year, are rooted in ideology rather than fact. Pension premiums are not considered a tax, nor are they a job killer.

While taxes are collected by governments to fund services like hospitals, schools, and police, the ORPP operates differently. Contrary to popular belief, pensions are not controlled by politicians. Pension premiums, including those of the ORPP, go directly into a separate fund managed by an independent entity, ensuring that the government remains at arm's length. Pension premiums are invested in diversified funds, relying on future accruals to return the invested money—along with added investment income—to pensioners upon retirement. If workers eventually receive their money back with additional gains, and the government never gains access, this should not be considered a tax.

The question remains whether pension premiums are the "job killers" that were once warned of by Harper and are now parroted by Ontario's PC Party and various business lobby groups. Despite fears when Ontario raised its minimum wage in 2014, the province's unemployment rate actually decreased. Similarly, an increase in CPP premiums in the 1900s led to a decline in unemployment.

The Conservative government's economic research, which they once sought to suppress, concluded that there was no reason to fear CPP expansion. Expanding CPP benefits would ultimately lead to economic benefits, increased retirement income, and more consumption opportunities for seniors. The Conference Board of Canada also found that any minimal impact caused by the ORPP in its early years would be considerably offset by future gains.

There are numerous reasons for a robust pension plan with diversified investments, economies of scale, and long-term planning that ensures individuals do not outlive their savings. With the era of stable, lifetime jobs with workplace pensions ending and giving way to precarious employment for younger generations, the necessity of a strong pension plan becomes even more apparent.

Critics of the ORPP should not profit from misinformation or rely on public misunderstandings. It is essential to eliminate the myth of "job-killing payroll taxes" and to understand the real benefits of a comprehensive pension plan for Ontario's future.
