CHICAGO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Monsanto Co on Tuesday forecast that its profit will likely fall next year as the strong dollar and low crop prices hurt demand for its pesticides and seeds, prompting the U.S. company to cut its quarterly dividend.

The world’s largest seed company’s forecast for a drop in earnings per share for next year was its first guidance for 2016, after it announced plans last month to buy the world’s biggest herbicide maker, Syngenta AG, to become a one-stop shop for crop chemicals and seeds.

Faced with a 26 percent fall in soybean seed sales and a 23 percent drop in corn seed sales this year, Monsanto has cut 5 percent of its labor force this year and has been closing seed production facilities. The company has said it will likely close more facilities, and it has warned that volatile commodity prices could lead to more such belt-tightening.

“The strong dollar and low prices for soybean, corn and other crops have significantly impacted Monsanto’s profitability,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Shapiro said on a conference call with reporters.

The company’s forecast for a profit of $5.5 billion in 2016 compared with $6.1 billion in 2015, and $5.8 billion in 2016 compared with $6.5 billion in 2015.

Monsanto said it would cut its quarterly dividend by 12 cents per share to $0.36 per share.

Shares of Monsanto were down 3.2 percent at $114.77 in premarket trading.

The strong dollar is making U.S. goods more expensive overseas, while low crop prices are hitting demand for Monsanto’s seed and pesticide products, Shapiro said.

“We expect commodity markets to remain volatile and there is potential for further reductions in our dividend as commodity prices and costs continue to fluctuate,” Shapiro said.

Monsanto has been buying assets to bolster its offerings in the face of a potential slowdown in the global food market.
