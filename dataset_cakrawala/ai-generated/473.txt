Gaining a lead in the NHL significantly impacts various aspects of the game, including momentum, pressure, aggression, crowd enthusiasm, and a coach's approach to game management. It is a common observation that elite NHL teams often score first and secure victory when they do so, as evidenced by statistics from this season's games up until Friday.

The Boston Bruins' record is 6-3-2 when they trail first, while the Hurricanes record is 7-9-0 when their opponents score first. It's also evident that teams in playoff positions are usually the ones adept at closing out their opponents when leading into the final 20 minutes of play. A notable example is the Philadelphia Flyers, who haven't lost once in regulation when leading after two periods. However, their record takes a drastic turn when it comes to trailing after two periods.

Examining the teams that struggle when down entering the third period this season reveals several non-playoff teams in the mix. Interestingly, the Nashville Predators are a surprising addition to this group, with a 1-10-1 record when trailing after two periods. This stands in sharp contrast to their previous track record, which saw them rally to win seven times in 27 games in the last season and lead the league with a .273 winning percentage when trailing after two periods (6 wins in 22 games) in the 2010-11 season.

Last season, the Montreal Canadiens fared worst when trailing after two periods, with a score of 1-26-5, followed closely by the Los Angeles Kings with 1-22-3. However, this season, these teams rank fifth (.333) and eighth (.273) respectively, illustrating a significant improvement in their performance in such situations.
