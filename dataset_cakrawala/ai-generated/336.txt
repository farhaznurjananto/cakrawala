Konami, the Japanese video game company, has announced that it will bring the popular children's card game and TV series, Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist, to PC. The announcement was made in a press release detailing the company's plans for the New York Comic Con. The release explained that the game would come to Steam soon, accompanied by a major update, the details of which will be unveiled at the NYCC.

Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist is a digital version of the game, featuring plotlines from various anime series since 2000. Players can enjoy total deck customization options and accurate rules engine from real life. The Xbox version, priced at $19.99, features DLC packs that are sold for $4.99. As of now, it is unclear whether the game's pricing structure will remain the same for the PC version.

Although the details about the PC version are scarce, Legacy of the Duelist has been available on handheld devices for some time and is well-known for its extensive card collection and fun gameplays.

It is unclear whether the game will have cross-platform compatibility, meaning players on PC can battle with Xbox or PlayStation players, but more information is expected to be released soon.

The post also contained a trailer for the console version that was launched last year. The announcement concluded with the writer's opinion that the best Yu-Gi-Oh series is Zexal and Zexal II, which is written remarkably well, self-aware and funny.
