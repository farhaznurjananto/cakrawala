Tyrannosaurus Rex has long been known for having relatively small arms, sparking controversy and humor from anti-fans. However, recent research shows that the arms of these massive creatures were heavily muscled, hinting that the animals may have used their arms to grapple with struggling prey. So enough of the jokes about T-Rex being weak; other dinosaurs had it worse, such as Carnotaurus.

While Tyrannosaurus Rex was among the most fearsome predators in North America and Asia, in South America, other theropod dinosaurs often played the same roles, such as the abelisaurids. Carnotaurus is the most famous of this group, with short, deep skulls and two prominent horns, making it look like a "meat-eating bull." Though fearsome to look at, the animal's arms are so small that some experts believe the limbs lack the ability to function properly in acquiring prey. 

In a new study published in Palaeontology, Javier Ruiz and his team reexamined the unusual arms of Carnotaurus and compared them to those of other abelisaurid predators, such as Majungasaurus and Aucasaurus. Their study showed that the arms of Carnotaurus have a robust lower portion, which is about one-quarter of the upper arm bone's length, made up of the radius and ulna. The hand has four fingers, with the fourth metacarpal bone being the biggest bone in the hand. This difference distinguishes Carnotaurus from the other abelisaurids studied, and the comparisons may add some new information about how the arms of these dinosaurs evolved.

In theropod evolution, the abelisaurid dinosaurs belong to a larger group called ceratosaurs. Earlier representatives of this group had relatively short and stubby hands, and it appears that the hands of abelisaurids have followed this evolutionary trend. However, it remains unclear why this reduction in limb size happened, and further research is required to understand why the hand of Carnotaurus was so small while the other arm bones were thick and powerful-looking, even compared to other abelisaurids.

The researchers conclude that the hands of the odd abelisaurids were as unique and diverse as the different arrangements of crests, horns, and bumps that adorned their skulls. Further study is necessary to understand how these structures relate to the lives of the animals themselves.
