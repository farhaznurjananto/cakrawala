Winter is coming, and with it comes hazardous driving conditions. It's essential to exercise safe driving habits to avoid accidents and ensure the safety of yourself and other motorists. It's crucial to create visibility in all directions by clearing snow off your vehicle before hitting the road. This includes ensuring that the windshield and windows are free of any fog or ice, which can significantly reduce visibility, thus leading to traffic hazards. If visibility is compromised due to inadequate cleaning of the vehicle, the OPP may lay Highway Traffic Act charges.

As a driver, there are a few simple things that you can do to lower the risk of a collision during winter. Firstly, give yourself extra time to reach your destination; as traffic will be slower than usual. Before hitting the road, ensure that you have completely cleared the snow and ice off your vehicle to allow for a clear view of the roadway. This includes clearing the headlights and taillights to avoid accidents due to restricted visibility. Keep a check on your windshield wiper fluid levels and keep an extra container in the car.

Moreover, while driving, reduce the risk of collisions by driving according to the road and weather conditions. It is essential to reduce your speed and increase your following distance to ensure you have enough time to stop safely in case of any emergency. Speeding is the most common reason for winter collisions. Accelerate slowly, and brake sooner to avoid spinouts, especially at intersections. It is advisable to check the weather forecast and avoid driving on hazardous roads.

Lastly, avoid driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Be responsible while driving in winter conditions and Arrive Alive.
