WASHINGTON In recent years, people who believe they were born in a body of the wrong gender have become more public, and social justice warriors have jumped on the bandwagon, engaging in fierce debates about the condition affecting 0.1 to 0.5 percent of the population. The name for this phenomenon has been changed from "gender identity disorder" to "gender dysphoria," in effect de-pathologizing it, in the latest edition of the psychiatrists' "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual," due to intense pressure from LGBT activists. The impact of the new wave of transgender activism on children is a topic that is rarely discussed. But it's easy to imagine the impact on impressionable children who see such people celebrated and given special treatment in the media. The cover of National Geographic magazine's January 2017 issue features a transgender child, as well as a section titled "Helping Families Talk About Gender" and an article titled "Rethinking Gender." The message: Some children will be never be happy or healthy unless they are allowed to express their "perceived gender."

Others, on the other hand, are concerned that these children are just going through a phase and will later regret any drastic measures taken to permanently change their gender. Walt Heyer, the founder of Sex Change Regret, is one such critic who has firsthand experience with the issue. He began cross-dressing at the age of four and underwent hormone therapy and sex-change surgery. He regretted his decision after eight years of living as a woman and underwent a second surgery to revert to his birth gender. Heyer is a regular contributor to The Federalist. Heyer wrote in a January article about the National Geographic gender issue, "studies have shown that childhood gender dysphoria does not inevitably continue into adulthood." "A staggering 77 to 94 percent of gender dysphoric children do not grow up to be gender dysphoric adults," he said. Heyer attributes the rise in the number of children who believe they have "gender dysphoria" to magazines such as National Geographic. "A visually appealing cover photo can persuade young people that male and female gender models are not fixed, even if they are. Photos like the one on the cover of National Geographic can cause a child to question his or her gender and sex, leading to inappropriate behavior "He put pen to paper. Heyer's theory is supported by a paper written by three prominent doctors. Dr. Paul Hruz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, along with Dr. Lawrence Mayer and Dr. Paul McHugh of Johns Hopkins University, published a study showing that cases of "gender dysphoria" in children have increased significantly in recent years. They cited data from the United Kingdom's Gender Identity Development Service, which only treats patients under the age of 18. Referrals for children with "gender dysphoria" increased by nearly 2,000 percent from 94 in 2009/2010 to 1,986 in 2016/2017. Referrals to a clinic in Toronto, Canada, increased from approximately 20 per year in 2004 to nearly 100 per year in 2011. The three doctors believe that the rise in controversial medical intervention is exacerbating young people's obsession with becoming the opposite gender, when most would naturally grow out of the feelings if left alone. "Medical treatments provided for children with obvious symptoms of gender dysphoria, including affirmation of gender expression from the earliest evidence of cross-gender behaviors, may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have found their gender to be aligned with their sex as they grow older," they wrote. "Children's gender identity is elastic (it can change over time) and plastic (that is, it can be shaped by forces like parental approval and social conditions). If the increased use of gender-affirming care causes children to continue to identify as the opposite sex, many children who would not otherwise require ongoing medical treatment will be subjected to hormonal and surgical interventions." Although most children outgrow transgender feelings if left alone, experts warn that the increased attention paid to transsexuals has resulted in more parents seeking treatment, which solidifies the condition. However, in some countries, parents are compelled to seek medical confirmation for their gender-questioning child due to factors other than media coverage and peer pressure. It is the rule of the land. Get David Kupelian's cultural war blockbusters "The Marketing of Evil," "How Evil Works," and his latest, "The Snapping of the American Mind" at the WND Superstore.
