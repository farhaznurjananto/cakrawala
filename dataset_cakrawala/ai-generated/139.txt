"This is not the first motorcycle accident we've had in this area and people need to slow down a bit," said Sgt. John Satterfield.

Satterfield said the motorcycle accidents are typically caused by people not paying attention to the traffic around them.

"Motorcycles are not as tall as cars and they are not as fast, so people need to take care when they're driving around these types of vehicles," he said.

Satterfield said the best way to avoid a motorcycle accident is to obey the rules of the road.

"Just be aware of what's going on around you and be sure to drive defensively," he said.

Satterfield said if someone is injured in a motorcycle accident, they should call 911.
