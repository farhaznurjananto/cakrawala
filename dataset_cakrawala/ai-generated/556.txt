Paul McKeever, the head of the Police Federation, expressed concerns about the ability of Conservative Chief Whip, Andrew Mitchell, to continue holding public office after allegations that the minister called policemen "plebs." Mr. Mitchell was threatened with arrest after reportedly telling officers they had "best learn your f------ place." He later apologized for not giving police "the respect they deserve" and denied using abusive language. He also returned to Downing Street to speak in person to the officer involved.

"It is hard to fathom how someone who holds the police in such contempt could be allowed to hold public office," Mr. McKeever stated. "Mr. Mitchell’s half-hearted apology for the comments made while leaving Downing Street will do little to build bridges with the police who feel they have once again been treated with a lack of respect and civility by members of this government."

Mr. McKeever emphasized that the comments were particularly disrespectful in light of the recent deaths of two serving police officers in Manchester. “The lack of regard that some within government appear to hold police officers in is especially disappointing during this tragic week for the service and does nothing for the rock-bottom morale of officers in this country,” he added.

Mr. Mitchell is said to have condemned the officers guarding Number 10 as "morons" for refusing to let him through the main gate with his bicycle. He denied using some of the words reported in the media, but apologized to the officers involved. A Downing Street spokesperson stated that the Prime Minister is aware of the incident and is glad that Mr. Mitchell has apologized, noting that the police should always be treated with the respect they deserve.

Mr. Mitchell was appointed to the role of chief whip in this month's Cabinet reshuffle, having previously served as International Development Secretary. He has more recently been dubbed 'Fifty Shades' by backbenchers, after the erotic novel. In light of his alleged tirade against the police, the question of whether or not Mr. Mitchell should be sacked is now a subject of debate.
