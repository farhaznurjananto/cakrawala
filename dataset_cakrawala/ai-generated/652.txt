Malaysia Airlines is approaching the final stages of its comprehensive restructuring plan, an effort to recover from the tragic events of last year. A significant component of this plan involves reducing the workforce by around one-third, with the layoff expected to impact between 6,000 and 8,000 of the current 20,000 staff members. A senior administrator has been appointed to oversee this major transition.

A company spokesperson stated, "All employees will get the termination letters and either a letter to join the new company or to register for outplacement." Despite these updates, the airline's operations continue as usual, according to CEO Christoph Mueller.

Flight MH370's mysterious disappearance and the downing of MH17 have severely impacted Malaysia Airlines' reputation. Consequently, the airline was delisted from the stock market and taken private by Khazanah Nasional (Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund), which unveiled a $1.8 billion restructuring plan.

This comprehensive plan includes key reforms such as cutting unprofitable routes, appointing new senior management, and reducing the workforce. Recently, the airline has started selling off various assets as part of the reorganization process, including its stake in travel distributor Abacus.

Malaysia Airlines' current CEO, Christoph Mueller, was hired from the Irish carrier Aer Lingus. Mueller guided Aer Lingus through challenging competition, establishing a sustainable business model that consistently generated profits. Malaysia Airlines hopes his expertise will lead the company through a successful revamp.

Before the twin tragedies, Malaysia Airlines was already in dire straits, despite previous restructuring plans and billions of dollars in financial aid from the government. The company had not turned a profit since 2008, and in the three years leading up to 2013, cumulative losses totaled $1.3 billion.

Khazanah Nasional declined to comment on the ongoing progress of the restructuring initiative.
