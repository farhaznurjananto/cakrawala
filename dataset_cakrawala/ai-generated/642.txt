The Ducks have triumphantly secured their second 2015 class commitment with the enlistment of Jacob Breeland, a tight end from Mission Viejo (Calif.) Trabuco Hills High School.

Recently, the 6-foot-5, 210-pound athlete visited the University of Oregon and was deeply impressed by what he experienced. Breeland praised the Oregon program as unparalleled, highlighting the supportive staff, exceptional academic assistance, and state-of-the-art technology and facilities.

After discussing the visit with his family, they all reached the consensus that attending the University of Oregon was the ideal choice for him. Breeland's father, an ex-USC player from the late 1980s, wholeheartedly endorsed his son's decision, emphasizing that Oregon presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Confident in his choice, Breeland stated that he will not be pursuing any other college options. He plans to return to Oregon for an official visit in September during his bye week, and fully commits to the University as the best decision for his future athletic and academic endeavors.
