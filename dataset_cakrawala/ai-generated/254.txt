A massive wave of protests demanding an end to Israeli airstrikes on Gaza occurred on January 3, 2009, and ended up with a display of shoe-hurling at the gates of Downing Street. At least 5,000 Palestinian supporters rallied outside the Israeli Embassy in London, while 12,000 people marched through the city center with famous Human Rights Campaigner Bianca Jagger, former mayor Ken Livingstone, and singer Annie Lennox. The rally was reportedly the largest one in London, with a violent turn that saw riot police getting pelted with missiles, burning of Israeli flags, and destructive behavior from some demonstrators. 

Earlier protests took place in various cities around the country, with up to 500 people braved the cold to exercise their rights in Edinburgh while 2,000 people took part in Manchester. However, Paris was at the forefront of the protests with the biggest protest rally, featuring 25,000 people who gathered in Paris to condemn the Israeli offensive on Gaza. The rallies were held globally, and Amsterdam, Berlin, Athens, and Madrid were among the cities that protested. 

The death toll as of that date was appalling, with at least 436 Palestinians losing their lives, including seventy-five children, and almost 2,300 people wounded in the territory since December 27th. On the other hand, Hamas, the Islamist militants who had taken over Gaza three years ago, had reportedly killed four Israelis with rocket attacks. These figures were a significant source of anger and contributed to the global protest which drew protesters' attention.

Protesters across the UK showed frustration at the country's Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, as he refused to condemn Israel's attacks, thereby criticizing his government for being silent while Israel continued with the airstrikes. Approximately 1,000 pairs of shoes lined the street outside Downing Street while angry demonstrators sang, "Shame on you, have my shoe." The throwing of shoes was in the spirit of an Iraqi journalist who threw his foot ware at President George Bush in 2008. The prime minister's refusal to condemn Israel's actions fueled the protest with many Britons expressing disappointment at their institutions for their silence.

The protest was generally peaceful, but the demonstration outside the Israeli Embassy in Kensington ended in violence. Approximately 5,000 protesters left the agreed route and headed for the embassy, where hundreds of officers confronted them with truncheons and gas canisters, leading to a standoff. A few demonstrators threw sticks, stones, and fireworks at the diplomatic mission and tried to storm the compound, leading to the police arresting ten protesters. 

In conclusion, despite the violence that was recorded, the protestâ€™s primary goal was to draw global attention to the terrible suffering in Gaza. Annie Lennox, George Galloway, and Bianca Jagger backed the protests, calling on the American President-elect, Barack Obama, to speak up against the bombardment. They recommended that dialogue should become the preferred approach instead of violence, which will ultimately harm everyone involved.
