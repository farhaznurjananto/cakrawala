President Pierre Nkurunziza is anticipated to be nominated for a third five-year term at a gathering of Burundi's ruling party on Saturday, a decision that critics say would be unconstitutional and could lead to unrest. Opposition groups have threatened to protest if Nkurunziza seeks another term, as they claim it would undermine a peace agreement that has maintained stability in the east African nation for a decade following the end of an ethnically-fuelled civil war in 2005.

The presidential election is set to take place in two months, and nearly a thousand members of the ruling party, including Nkurunziza, are attending the meeting in the capital, Bujumbura. During his opening speech, party chairman Pascal Nyabenda stated that the party is prepared to win the election democratically, expressing confidence in their victory.

Security has been increased in Bujumbura in anticipation of potential protests if the party nominates Nkurunziza. Civil rights activist Pierre Claver Mbonimpa urged meeting attendees not to elect Nkurunziza, as it would violate the constitution and the Arusha peace agreement. Mbonimpa stated that over 300 civil organizations would take to the streets in protest if the president is announced as a candidate.

Supporters of Nkurunziza argue that he is qualified to run in the June 26 election, as his first term should not be counted since he was chosen by parliament rather than being elected. Prior to the announcement, some opponents held street protests in April, resulting in altercations with the police. Any crackdown on protests could further escalate tensions in a country that has long suffered from ethnic violence.
