The appalling events that transpired in Charlottesville, Virginia shone a light on the connection between the alt-right's beliefs and the ideals of America's founders. This connection is most visible at the Jefferson Memorial in Charlottesville, which is home to the University of Virginia, the school Jefferson founded. Over the years, the city has become synonymous with Jefferson, and white nationalists often use Jefferson's writings to support their cause.

Although we all know Jefferson as the author of the Declaration of Independence's famous phrase, "all men are created equal," his writings also provide space for white nationalist interpretations. For example, overlooking the harsh truths of America's history with slavery, Jefferson wrote that "the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them." Such remarks show that even the most celebrated American heroes had problematic views regarding race.

Jefferson's writings influenced other historical events in American history as well. In the early 19th century, Jefferson and his colleagues inspired the American Colonization Society, which encouraged the return of free black people to Africa. This movement seen as a way to "resolve the problem" of free black people, aimed to send them back to Africa. Such ideas were an early precursor to the systemic oppression and segregation that black Americans would face in the years to come.

The most fundamental legislative goal of the white nationalist movement today is to limit nonwhite immigration into the United States. It is crucial to remember that such limitations were in place until the 1960s. For example, the first naturalization laws by the United States Congress, in the 1790s, limited citizenship to a "free white person." In the 1920s, Congress created quotas for immigration based on national origin, placing severe restrictions on the total number of immigrants and favoring northern and western European immigration.

This national origin quota system was abolished in the 1960s by the civil rights movement, and the restriction that favored white immigrants was removed. While these legislative efforts helped provide greater opportunities for minorities, the truth is that white nationalists see these policies as a threat to America's "white identity."

Of course, these historical anecdotes aren't here to defame our country's history. Rather, we need to acknowledge the fact that the white nationalist history embedded in American culture leads to events like the Charlottesville rally in the first place. When we preserve Confederate memorials without building monuments to historical Black leaders, we're missing the mark. It is essential to respect and recognize cultural heritage, but we also need to acknowledge the dangerous implications of supporting white nationalism.

At the Charlottesville rally, the organizers initially failed in their bid to make their movement appealing to the average white American. However, President Trump's comments offering support gave new energy to the white nationalist movement. Trump's failure to condemn white nationalism encouraged its growth, with the Charlottesville rally becoming a badge of honor for some people who wanted to associate themselves with this repugnant ideology. When the President of the United States fails to provide condemnation for an event like the Charlottesville rally, that sends a message of implicit encouragement.

In conclusion, while the events in Charlottesville were unbelievably distressing, they did highlight the dangerous implications of supporting white nationalism. It is crucial to recognize the dark history of white nationalism embedded in American culture that contributed to events at Charlottesville. It is also essential to ensure that we preserve our cultural heritage, but not at the cost of ignoring the contributions of African American leaders.
