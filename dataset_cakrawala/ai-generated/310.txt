In a recent appearance on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos", Rep. Peter King (R-NY) issued a warning about a serious and credible threat from Al Qaeda. King's warning comes in response to the heightened terror alerts across the globe over the weekend. The New York congressman expressed that "we have to be ready for everything" and that this is a "wake-up call". He continued to state that "Al Qaeda is in many ways stronger than it was before 9/11, because it’s mutated and spread, and can come at us in different directions. And al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula is probably the most deadly of al Qaeda affiliates." Although the threat is greatest in the Middle East, King suggested that a coordinated series of deadly attacks across the globe is within the realm of possibility.

As the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, King has been briefed on security threats regularly over the last seven or eight years. King stated that this is the most specific threat he has ever witnessed. His comments come after the Obama administration announced the closure of 21 U.S. embassies, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa, in response to intelligence of a terror threat linked to Al Qaeda. On Saturday, President Obama met with his national security team in response to the fluid situation.

Despite the credible threat, some analysts and congressional officials have advised that the administration's response is motivated by politics. A New York Times report has suggested that the moves are designed to shift attention away from the ongoing controversy over the NSA’s expansive surveillance program. However, King, who supports such surveillance, has dismissed such arguments as unfounded, stating that the security measures come in response to a credible threat from a dangerous extremist group.
