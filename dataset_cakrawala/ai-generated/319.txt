Quebec immigrants who choose to send their children to daycare will soon be required to enroll them in French-language childcare facilities, according to the province's family minister, Nicole Léger. The change is part of a broader effort to reinforce Bill 101, Quebec's French Language Charter, a move already made clear by Premier Pauline Marois. Léger stated that the proposed changes will be included in new legislation scheduled this autumn.  
 
The regulations around which types of childcare centers the legislation will apply to are as yet unclear. It remains to be seen whether these changes will apply to all daycare facilities or only French-language centers. However, Quebec, which already has many different types of childcare, may face some additional friction implementing the new legislation.  
 
One further change under consideration is to require companies with 11 to 50 employees to make French the only official language spoken in the workplace, rather than allowing the current rule to apply only to those employing 50 or more workers. The Parti Quebecois (PQ) is specifically targeting Montreal and western Quebec's Outaouais area to address the party's concerns that French is under threat in these regions.  
 
Most immigrants' children are already required to attend French-language schools under Bill 101. Requiring immigrant parents to send their children to French-language daycare facilities is likely to have a significant impact on families who do not feel that they have a high enough level of French language proficiency to do so. As the Quebec government pushes for the exclusive use of the French language in many areas, it remains to be seen how business and social groups - as well as individuals - will respond.
