If you thought the Raiders cutting a struggling, high-paid veteran was the worst thing that would happen in the NFL this week, you were wrong.

The Miami Dolphins released defensive end Dion Jordan on Thursday, just over two years after they made him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft. Jordan, who has battled multiple injuries and suspensions in his short career, was waived with a failed physical designation.

To be sure, there was no guarantee Jordan would have ever played another down in the NFL. He was suspended for the first four games of the 2014 season because he violated the league’s substance-abuse policy. He was suspended for the first six games of the 2015 season because he again violated the substance-abuse policy.

Jordan’s release Thursday was the result of a third failed drug test, a source told the Miami Herald. The Dolphins, who lost star defensive end Olivier Vernon to the New York Giants in free agency, were hoping Jordan could finally get his act together and contribute.

Jordan, 25, played in just 26 games in two seasons with the Dolphins. He had three sacks and 46 tackles.

The news wasn’t all bad for Jordan, though. He was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams have a need for a pass-rusher after releasing Robert Quinn earlier this week.

This is the latest in a string of high-profile NFL players to be released this week.

The Raiders cut Derek Carr’s former teammate and good friend, Latavius Murray, on Wednesday. Murray, who was signed to a three-year, $30 million contract in the offseason, was benched and made to compete with DeAndre Washington and Jalen Richard for the starting job.

The Redskins released receiver DeSean Jackson on Thursday. Jackson, 33, was released a day after the team signed veteran Josh Doctson. Jackson had been with the Redskins since 2015.

The Ravens released running back Terrance West on Thursday. West, a 2015 first-round pick, had struggled to get on the field in Baltimore. He was drafted to be the team’s lead back, but he averaged just 3.1 yards per carry in 2017 and 3.6 yards per carry this season.

The Ravens also released tackle Rick Wagner and linebacker Terrell Suggs.

The NFL is facing a wave of player releases this week as teams try to cut down their rosters to 53 players by Week
