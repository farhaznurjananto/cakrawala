The recent publication of a popular and authoritative Chinese dictionary, the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary, has sparked controversy and criticism for its deliberate omission of the contemporary homosexual definition of the word "tongzhi," which is widely used in present-day language to refer to gay men and lesbians. Traditionally, "tongzhi" signifies "comrade" and has often been employed in the context of the Communist Party. However, over the past few decades, the word has evolved to also encompass individuals who identify as homosexual.

The committee in charge of revising and updating the dictionary, whose sixth edition was published on July 15, explained that they chose to leave out the homosexual definition because they did not want to encourage its use. The director of the committee, Jiang Langsheng, confirmed this decision in an interview with Chengdu Business Daily. Despite its omission, the latest edition of the widely renowned dictionary contains 69,000 entries, adding 4,000 new definitions since the fifth edition's publication in 2005.

Activists, linguists, and the public have expressed their disapproval of this omission, stating that refusing to include a term that holds significant cultural and linguistic meaning in daily Chinese dialogue is unacceptable. Nan Feng, a gay rights activist, told the state-run news agency Xinhua that excluding the "gay" meaning of "tongzhi" from the dictionary simply due to the compilers' personal preferences and values is unjust.

"Tongzhi" often serves as a substitute for "tongxinglian," which is the formal Chinese term for homosexuality. Interestingly, the 2005 edition of the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary defines "tongxinglian" both as same-sex love and as a psychosexual disorder, even though homosexuality's classification as a mental disorder was removed in China in 2001.

Linguists, including Cui Yan, a planning editor for Science and Technology Document Press, have also expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to exclude a term that is widely used in daily conversations. Cui Yan told Beijing Business Daily that "there have always been good words and bad ones, but they are all linguistic phenomena. Just because the dictionary doesn't include them doesn't mean they don't exist."

Many people across the internet have joined activists and linguists in speaking out against the lack of the colloquial definition of "tongzhi" in the sixth edition of the dictionary. The controversy surrounding the term's exclusion raises questions about the role of dictionaries as reference materials and the importance of accurately reflecting evolving linguistic and cultural realities.
