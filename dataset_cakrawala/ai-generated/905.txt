Pope Francis worries me 
 
 I will be honest. I was shocked by what Pope Francis said in an interview published yesterday. I was confused because I knew  his comments would be used against pro-life and anti-marriage activists. I know abortion advocates will tell street councilors that the pope has told them not to be “obsessed” with abortion. Traditional marriage advocates will also be told that the pope said, "Who are you to judge?" 
 
 I'll be honest, I was annoyed. While  the pope is clearly not changing Church teaching, he is clearly changing the emphasis. The Pope in a few words was very unsettled. In short, the pope  unsettled me.  
 But I thought and prayed about it yesterday and finally realized that maybe it's not such a terrible thing. The Catholic faith was never established. We are called to set the world on fire with love. And I wonder if this is the time to give myself a chance to see my faith differently. To deepen it. I know  I may be guilty of being a little rude and mocking  those who disagree with Church teaching on life and marriage. 
 People smarter than me can tell you what the pope is talking about, but what I've learned is that the pope is telling us that faith is  much more  than the anti-abortion movement and the defense of marriage. . He does not drive them away, but he invites us to a deeper understanding of the faith. Ours
