Beer Nation has been closed due to nonpayment of rent. This happened three weeks after employees reported bounced paychecks, and two months after opening. Anyone who was looking forward to a cold Bud Light or Michelob Ultra, both featured on the initial menu, was greeted with a notice on the pub's front door stating that locks have been re-keyed, and the pub is closed for business. This occurrence did not come as a surprise to many, since Beer Nation's owner, Scott Hait, has had a similar experience with another pub in Indiana, which closed down shortly before landlords sued over delinquent rent.

When KPRC contacted Hait and his lawyer Trent Stephenson earlier this month, they declined to make any comments about the situation. It is sad to learn that the two of them, as well as manager Larry Kakos, are giving the press the silent treatment even after multiple attempts to reach them out. 

Hait, who resides in Michigan, recently settled a fraud lawsuit, which required him to pay $200,000 to a court-appointed receiver. This scam made other people suffer as well, including the employees who bounced checks and the landlords who didn't receive rent for the property.

Moreover, another group of people who would have to bear the brunt of this unfortunate situation are the fans of bands Puddle of Mudd and Sponge, which were going to play at Beer Nation's music hall. Unfortunately, the place closed down before this could happen.

Overall, the closure of Beer Nation is an unfortunate event that has left many customers, employees, and other stakeholders affected.
