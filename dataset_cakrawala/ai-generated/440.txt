The Li Gang case in China exemplifies how the propaganda machine in the country can sometimes be hamstrung in the internet age, especially when dealing with stories that highlight the abuse of power. Li Gang's son Li Qiming was involved in a hit and run accident in 2010, which caused the death of teenager Chen Xiaojun. Li Qiming, who was driving the car, boasted that his father was a powerful official and that there would be no repercussions for his actions.  This led to the case becoming widely known through social media as the public became outraged by the disregard for the rule of law and the power that allowed the likes of Li Qiming and his father to circumvent it. 

The Chinese government has long been known for its ability to slant or halt any media coverage to control the narrative. But trouble arises in the age of the internet as information can spread rapidly across social media, rendering propaganda ineffective. People have turned to social media to bypass the lies and misinformation that may come from state-controlled media. In the case of Li Gang, the government tried to shape public reaction by restricting media coverage. However, social media outlets became a platform for people to share news of the story, provoking public outrage. 

As the story unfolded on social media, an enduring grievance came to light. A widespread belief that powerful people can flout the rules that ordinary citizens have to abide by, resulting in the term 'guan er dai' and 'fu er dai' being coined; these refer to the "second generation," children of privileged government officials and the ultra-rich.

With social media, it's impossible to hide a story once it starts spreading, no matter how much the authorities try to contain it. In this case, an anonymous blog titled “Ministry of Truth,” began to leak damning government directives online. This helped to expose how the Chinese authorities try to control the story through directed coverage but ultimately fail. The Central Propaganda Department imposed a directive on 28th October, ten days after the accident. The directive stated, "ensuring there is no more hype regarding the disturbance over traffic at Hebei University."  Frustratingly for the authorities, the Li Gang case proved hard to suppress, with social media users sharing the story widely. 

As the public pressure on Li Qiming and his father intensified, the Chinese authorities tried to shape the story, but drastic measures like broadcasting interviews with Li Gang and his son failed. Instead, it further fueled the public's anger. Other attempts to control the story, like censoring the likes of the Chens’ lawyer, who gave interviews about the case, also backfired.

Eventually, the Chens, the family of the victim, and the family of the perpetrator reached a settlement. However, it seems that even this agreement failed to quash chatter about the story. Students from Hebei University questioned this week about the handling of the case were unanimously critical. "This is the kind of society we live in,” one student remarked angrily. “People who have power, they can cover up the sky. We want this settled according to the law."

In conclusion, the story of Li Gang and his son is, unfortunately, the norm in China, but it highlights how the propaganda machine can't always control how people act online. Social media is an outlet for people in China to voice their opinion and expose cases of corruption and power abuse. However, China remains one of the most controlled countries in the world when it comes to censoring, and the state will continue to use propaganda to curtail the spread of dissenting voices.
