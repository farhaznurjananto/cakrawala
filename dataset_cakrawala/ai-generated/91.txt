2016 has been a busy year for us at AECO. In addition to our on-going work with the International Polar Year, we have been busy with the 7th International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS VII) and the Arctic Frontiers conference. We are also working hard on the preparations for the next Arctic Observing Summit in 2017.

Arctic Observing Summit

Preparations for the next Arctic Observing Summit (AOS) in March 2017 are well underway. AOS is one of the key forums for the international Arctic observing community and in 2017 its focus will be on the Arctic Observing Summit Science Strategic Framework. We are working closely with the organizers to ensure that AOS 2017 is a successful and important event.

Arctic Frontiers

The Arctic Frontiers conference, held in Tromsø, Norway, in January 2016, was a great success. We were pleased to have been able to host a side event at the conference, “Science and Society: The Importance of Long-Term Research,” where we highlighted the importance of long-term studies for understanding long-term trends in Arctic ecosystems and climate.

7th International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences

The 7th International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS VII) was held in Fairbanks, Alaska, from July 25 to July 29, 2016. ICASS VII is the largest annual meeting of its kind and featured presentations from more than 230 scientists from around the world. We were proud to be a co-organizer of the Congress and to have participated in a number of working groups, including the Scientific Program Committee, the Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Social Science Program Committee. We are looking forward to ICASS VIII, which will be held in Inuvik, Canada, in 2020.

2016 has been a busy year for us at AECO, and we are looking forward to continued progress in 2017. Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,
