Despite the controversy surrounding “Atheism Plus,” many atheists firmly believe in social justice and helping those in need. They feel that they are equally capable of making a difference to support various social concerns. These efforts would go beyond debating issues about the existence of gods. 

Supporting marriage equality is an urgent cause that atheists should promote. This issue is particularly important to one writer because their home state of Washington would be voting to support same-sex marriage rights in November. The effort around marriage equality urgently needs volunteers to make phone calls to undecided voters, host fundraising events, canvas neighborhoods, and convince businesses to support the issue. 

When atheists are suffering, they need support. Therefore, it's essential to form support groups that atheists can rely on during tough times, like recovering from religious abuse, or after a loss of a loved one. Additionally, atheists can visit the elderly residents, who are often forgotten or ignored, in nursing homes. Visiting them at these institutions could bring unexpected joy and comfort to the patients. 

Another area where atheists could get involved is lobbying. There’s an urgent need to support legislation that will help alleviate poverty, increase opportunity, and improve education. Organizations such as the ACLU, FFRF, and the Secular Coalition for America are already doing great work in this field. Atheists can volunteer or donate to these organizations or even contact their representatives for direct action. 

Young atheists also deserve support to help them succeed, which is why groups like the Secular Student Alliance are essential for the next generation. However, the quest for a proper education is not only limited to young atheists. We also need to tackle the challenges faced by public schools, which often leave children from low-income families behind in education. 

Prison reform is also another area that requires extensive work. The US has the highest per capita incarceration rate globally, indicating a more pervasive societal problem. Rather than building more prisons, it's important to focus on reducing poverty, providing better education & rehabilitating prisoners. Additionally, atheists can seek to help rehabilitate inmates and juveline detainees who are currently overlooked or underserved. 

Finally, foster care is a critical issue among many social concerns that need reform. There are not enough foster parents for children in need, and social services won’t place them with a foster family if there's any hope of returning them to their parents. 

In summary, atheists can play a crucial role in improving different areas of social justice. These actions are beyond "Atheism Plus" debates about the existence of gods. Lengthy to-do lists have been created to ensure marriage equality, establish support groups, visit nursing homes, better educate the youth, and support proper legislation. It’s also necessary to focus on the improvement of the prison and foster care systems. These efforts will help make a tangible difference for those in need, and atheists can activists in these battles.
