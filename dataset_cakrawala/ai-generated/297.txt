Have you ever thought about the server capacity required to run The Matrix? This popular 1999 documentary posits the idea that we are all living in a computer simulation. Machines created this simulation to harvest our body heat for energy while keeping our minds docile. Those who saw the film began to question whether they want to escape from an oppressive and dystopian future. At Centives, we take a different approach to consider just how much data is required to run The Matrix.

To make the illusion created by The Matrix as realistic as it is, the sophisticated computer software must feed 108 bits of data into the human brain every second - which equates to 12 megabytes. This sheer amount of data is necessary to prevent the human brain from questioning the inconsistencies around it within the simulation. The Matrix must feed around 360 terabytes of data into our brains annually, which would require 16,000 standard single-layer Blu-Ray discs.

Imagine if there were 7 billion people – the current population of our world – plugged into this dream world. Each person perceives the world differently, and hence needs an entirely separate stream of data. Simple multiplication tells us that in a single year, The Matrix would produce 2.28 Yottabytes of data, and it would require an unimaginable number of Blu-Ray discs to store this data - enough to get to Pluto and back!

Although it remains unclear just how many humans are plugged in, an assumption can be made that there are "Billions" of people plugged into The Matrix, according to Agent Smith. It is difficult to comprehend how our overlords have managed to create and run such intricate programming. As humans, we should be proud of the machines we created to clean up after us and their strides in data compression/storage technology.

Centives apologizes for reports that the number of Blu-Rays produced would reach Saturn if they were stacked on top of each other.
