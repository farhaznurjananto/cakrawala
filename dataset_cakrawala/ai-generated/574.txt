The increasing dependence on mobile devices has become a major concern for health professionals, as shown by a recent TIME mobility poll. The survey, which included 5,000 participants, found that a staggering 84% of individuals claimed they could not endure a single day without their mobile devices. Furthermore, 25% admitted to checking their phones every 30 minutes, demonstrating a critical need for constant connectivity.

This need for staying connected extends beyond smartphone usage, affecting overall physical health as well. A study presented at the British Psychological Society's annual Occupational Conference discovered that a concerning 70% of employees failed to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. On average, these employees spent 5 hours and 41 minutes daily at their desks, which could potentially lead to a myriad of health issues.

According to Geralyn Coopersmith, MA, CSCS, and a member of the Equinox Fitness Training Institute, the human body is specifically designed for movement rather than inactivity. Prolonged sitting may result in various posture problems and could contribute to the development of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

Health professionals recommend taking regular breaks from screens approximately every hour to engage in movement or even stepping outside for fresh air. By incorporating these small but essential changes, individuals can strike a healthier balance between technology usage and overall physical wellbeing. These suggestions help raise awareness about the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle amidst today's modern, technology-driven environment.
