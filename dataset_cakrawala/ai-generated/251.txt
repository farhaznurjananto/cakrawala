The disparity between the voting patterns of Chicago as a city at large, and certain pockets of the city, is surprising to many. Generally considered a Democratic stronghold, the city of Chicago nonetheless has a significant number of Trump supporters, particularly in the areas of Mount Greenwood, Edison Park, and Norwood Park, three neighborhoods with a high population of police officers and firefighters.

Mount Greenwood, in particular, stands out as an area with great support for Trump, as he won almost 70% of the vote in three Mount Greenwood precincts and over 50% in 15 other precincts in Chicago's 19th Ward, which includes the Beverly neighborhood. These are middle-class areas with a working-class population, and many of the inhabitants view Trump as a way to revive the economy, support law enforcement, and reform the stagnant political system.

Despite this support, however, many of these Trump voters express concern about the President and his actions since taking office. Angela Brancato, a Mount Greenwood resident who works at a local diner, is concerned that President Trump's combative language and abrasive comments may lead the country astray. Similarly, Dave Benedict, owner of United TV Service, voted for Trump because he appreciated "a businessman's approach to running the country," but he is concerned about the direction of Trump's administration and policies.

One of the reasons for this reluctance to support the current President wholeheartedly may lie in the contentious nature of the 2016 Presidential Election, particularly in Chicago. Three days prior to the election, a police officer shot and killed Joshua Beal, a 25-year-old African-American from Indianapolis, in Mount Greenwood. Although authorities say the shooting came as a result of a road rage incident, the killing still sparked protests that divided the community along racial lines.

The sense of unease among Trump's supporters in Chicago is heightened by concerns about his ability to collaborate with those whose politics differ from his, as his public comments frequently lead to uproar and controversy. Trump, however, remains determined to move ahead with his campaign promises and his plans to reshape the country, and only time will tell if he can succeed in unifying the nation as a whole.
