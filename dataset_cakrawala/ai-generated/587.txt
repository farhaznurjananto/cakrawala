New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's approval ratings have hit a historic low of 15%, according to a recent Monmouth University poll. The governor's popularity was already dwindling before he faced public backlash for being photographed lounging on a closed state beach during the government shutdown. However, despite this significant decline in approval, Christie has asserted that he remains apathetic towards his constituents' opinions.

The poll's results revealed that 54% of respondents held both Christie and the state legislature equally responsible for the budget impasse that led to the shutdown of non-essential government services for the first three days of July. An additional 28% placed a larger portion of the blame on Christie, while 14% pointed more towards the legislature's role.

This budget disagreement stemmed from proposed legislation giving the state increased control over its largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. Interestingly, 54% of respondents in the poll believed that the legislation was driven by political vengeance against the insurer. A noteworthy 90% of Horizon subscribers involved in the poll reported being at least somewhat satisfied with their insurance.

Compared to Governor Christie, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez enjoys significantly greater popularity, with 41% of New Jersey respondents approving of his job performance and 36% disapproving. Senator Cory Booker's ratings were even higher, with 49% of respondents expressing approval and 30% disapproval.

The Monmouth University Poll of 800 New Jersey adults was conducted from July 6 to July 9, 2021, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
