Comprehensive immigration reform is essential for a stronger American society and economy. However, provisions in the current Senate bill (S. 744) could impose intrusive identification (ID) systems on citizens and aspiring citizens. Mandatory worker IDs and electronic verification requirements would eliminate the right of citizens to work without proof of government approval. Such systems are detrimental to a free society and the economy, as well as violating constitutional rights and freedoms. 

Any citizen seeking employment would first need to provide a high-resolution passport or driver's license photo to be stored centrally in a Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services database. This central database would be verified using facial recognition technology against the job applicant's government-issued "enhanced" ID card. Biometric (based on body measurements like fingerprint scans and digital images) worker ID cards would be required for immigrant employees, and social security cards may become biometric as well. Anyone whose digital image doesn't match the one in the government-issued ID would not have the right to work or receive benefits. 

In the Butchers Union Co. decision in 1884, the US Supreme Court recognized "the right to follow any of the common occupations of life" as "an inalienable right," under the phrase "pursuit of happiness." This right is a significant part of the civil liberties of every citizen. However, the digital ID requirements in S. 744 eliminate that fundamental right to work.

S. 744 also undermines constitutional federalism by reintroducing ID provisions that most states have rejected. The bill mandates "E-Verify" as a national electronic verification system for employment, while "Real ID" requirements collect driver's license photos among the states and federal government. Only 13 states joined this initiative, as 25 states opposed it by law or resolution since it's a violation of individual rights. 

The overall E-Verify system would cost individuals and businesses extensive amounts both in time and costs. Americans without driver's licenses must travel to vital records offices for birth or marriage certificates, become eligible for state IDs, and travel to motor vehicle agencies to undergo E-Verification. Moreover, they may not be able to work since they cannot get proper documentation. Installing such a system to E-Verify the entire labor force would cost taxpayers and small businesses billions.

These ID provisions divert attention and resources from comprehensive policy measures to legalize more immigrants, workers, and workplaces. The more effective and simpler alternatives would reduce invasive and unconstitutional ID verification systems. For instance, the longstanding provisions for citizens to attest to their rights or answer questions about previous addresses and other details. 

In essence, a comprehensive worker ID system violates fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms. Together, efficient public policy measures must let people enter and leave through the front door to reduce the pressures for invasive and unconstitutional ID verification systems.
