The entertainment industry is believed to be on the verge of collapse due to piracy, as per the leaders of the copyright-focused industries. The makers of SOPA and PIPA claimed that they were financially steamrolled by piracy, and they suffer losses amounting to billions of dollars. However, new data uncovered by Techdirt shows that this is far from true, and the industry is doing booming business. 

The Music Industry is Leading the Way

The value of the recording industry skyrocketed from $132 billion in 2005 to $168 billion in 2010, with recording artistsâ€™ share of music revenue jumping 16% to $16.7 billion. The overall entertainment industry experienced a growth of 66% from 1998 to 2010, and employment in this industry rose by 20% during the same period. Worldwide box office revenue grew from $25.5 billion in 2006 to $31.8 billion in 2010, and book publishing revenues increased from $26.5 billion in 2008 to 28 billion in 2010. The video game industry flourished, rising from $20 billion in 2000 to nearly $80 billion in 2012.

No Concrete Data Proves Financial Losses in Copyright Industry

Indeed, the entertainment industry is doing well, as revealed by the data. Therefore, the claims of copyright industries suffering financial losses due to piracy are questionable, which seems unfounded. The assumption of the copyright industry relies on analogies of the physical world, which do not apply to the digital world. If someone steals a box of Twinkies, there is one less item that 7-Eleven can sell, resulting in a $6 loss. However, in the digital world, files can be reproduced in unlimited quantities. Therefore, if someone pirates a copy of a movie or a song, it may not necessarily mean a loss of revenue for the entertainment industry, as there is no guarantee that the person would have paid to access that content if piracy were not an option. 

Fictitious Claims Are Misleading

Even if a pirated copy replaces a purchase, this still does not mean that it guarantees a loss for the entertainment industry. To believe that, one would have to be entirely sure that the person would not have spent the money saved elsewhere. Thus, it is essential to realize that many customers set aside a portion of their income for entertainment, and if they pirate a few movies, they may subscribe to other streaming services, buy tickets to live shows, and indulge in other entertainment options. 

The entertainment industry is thriving, and the copyright industry has no concrete evidence to prove that they are suffering from piracy. Although SOPA and PIPA have been temporarily shelved, they might return with new names and may be framed slightly differently. The copyright industry will continue to use its resources to convince lawmakers of the losses they suffer, but stakeholders must take these claims with a pinch of salt.
