I've bought 25 of these in the last 3 years, no issues. I use them in a Micro Slow stick that I built and upgraded so I could fly fast for other RC folks. I have never burned out. Its weak point is its shaft that bends when hit. That weakness aside, this motor is robust and powerful, with a 7-inch propeller and a  high C-rated 3-series lipo.
