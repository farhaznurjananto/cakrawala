The New England Patriots, led by the legendary coach Bill Belichick and star quarterback Tom Brady, won six Super Bowl titles in the last two decades. But the Patriots' success is often mired by suspicious activities and allegations of cheating, making them one of the most contentious and controversial teams in the NFL.

It all started in 2007 when the Patriots were caught videotaping the signals of the New York Jets' defensive coaches. The infamous "Spygate" scandal drew a $500,000 fine for Belichick, $250,000 for the team, a loss of a first-round draft pick, and a wave of rumors of how deep the Patriots' cheating runs.

As teams continued to complain about the Patriots' unsavory tactics, the NFL started implementing rules to curtail their behavior. For example, in 2015, the NFL made it illegal to use defenseless receivers as a "pick" to block defenders, a tactic often used by the Patriots. In that same year, the NFL began providing its own instructors to oversee communications between coaches and quarterbacks to prevent Belichick's alleged interference with the radios.

The league's investigations would continue in 2015, with the "Deflategate" affair following the AFC Championship Game between the Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots were accused of using underinflated footballs to reduce air resistance and gain an edge in the game. Brady was initially suspended for four games, and the team was fined $1 million and docked their first-round draft selection.

Many NFL executives and insiders believe that the Patriots kept crossing the line in defiance of the rules. Whenever a team plays against the Patriots, they must take extensive security measures to protect their strategies and signals. Visitors often sweep their hotels and changing rooms for hidden cameras or bugs, hire extra guards, or even practice at different locations than they typically would. Some teams provide their own water and Gatorade rather than relying on the Patriots' supply, fearing foul play.

One long-time head coach even ran fake plays in his team's walkthroughs at Gillette Stadium, the Patriots' home field, because he believed they were spying on his team. Another opponent locked the doors to their hotel rooms, eventually compromising with the Pats by placing tables in front of the doors.

Controversy also always arises in Gillette's gadgetry, with many teams sensing nefarious activities. In particular, many teams claim that their radios always fail whenever they play the Patriots. In 2006, when the Jacksonville Jaguars visited Gillette, their coach stated that their headsets mysteriously malfunctioned for most of the first half.

In conclusion, the New England Patriots remain a highly questionable and controversial team in the NFL. Even though the Patriots have continued to deny any wrongdoing, and added three more Super Bowls to their collection, multiple allegations of deceitful actions continue to plague their reputation in the league.
