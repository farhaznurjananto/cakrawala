Changes in Behavior and How People See Their Weaknesses About two-thirds of the investigative journalists surveyed (64%) think that the U.S. government has probably collected information about their phone calls, emails, or online communications, and eight out of ten think that being a journalist makes it more likely that their information will be collected. A new survey of members of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), a nonprofit organization for journalists, by the Pew Research Center and Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism found that 71% of those who write about national security, foreign affairs, or the federal government think the government has already collected information about their electronic communications. So far, worries about surveillance and hacking haven't stopped most journalists from pursuing a story or a source. Only 14% of journalists say that these worries have stopped them from pursuing a story or reaching out to a particular source, or have made them think about leaving investigative journalism altogether in the past year. Still, because of these worries, many of these journalists have changed how they work in the past year. Almost half (49%) say they have changed at least a little bit how they store or share sensitive documents, and 29% say the same thing about how they talk to other reporters, editors, or producers. And 38% of the 454 people who say they are reporters say they have changed at least a little bit how they talk to sources in the past year. When it comes to protecting them from surveillance and hacking from the outside, these investigative journalists don't put much faith in their ISPs (referred to as ISPs). Only 2% of people "have a lot of faith" that their ISP can keep their data from being accessed by people who shouldn't be able to, while 71% don't have much or any faith at all. People have different opinions about how well news organizations can keep their employees' communications safe. 589 of the 671 journalists surveyed work for news organizations. Of those, half say their employer is not doing enough to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and hacking. About the same number (47%) say their employer is doing enough. Just 21% say their organization has taken steps or made policies in the past year to protect journalists and their sources. 36% say their organization has not, and 42% don't know. About half (54%) say they haven't gotten any formal training or instruction on electronic security issues from professional sources like journalism associations, news organizations, or journalism schools. Still, there are more important issues for the job than spying and hacking. When asked to rank four problems that journalists face today, almost all of them (88%) say that a lack of resources in newsrooms is their biggest worry. Nothing else even comes close. Following far behind are legal actions against journalists (5%), electronic surveillance by governments or corporations (4%), and hacking that targets journalists or news organizations (1%). Also, only 27% of journalists have spent at least "some time" in the past year looking into how to make their electronic security better. Overall, these data show that investigative journalists feel vulnerable to surveillance and hacking, but not so much that most of them are changing the way they do their jobs or spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to do so. And almost all of the people who were asked (97%) said that for journalists today, the benefits of digital communication like email and cell phones are greater than the risks. Only 3% think that the risks are worse than the benefits. This Poll Is About The analysis in this report is based on a survey of 671 journalists who are members of Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. The survey was done online from December 3 to December 28, 2014, with a representative sample of 671 journalists (IRE). There are a variety of reporters, producers, editors, data specialists, photojournalists, and others among the 671 investigative journalists. They cover a wide range of topics. Staff at the Pew Research Center wrote and analyzed the survey, and Princeton Survey Research Associates International did the field work (PSRAI). Members of IRE who are investigative journalists in the United States were sent emails with links to the online study that let them take their own surveys. Journalists could also send back a hard copy of the survey through the mail. For more detailed information, see the Methodology section.
