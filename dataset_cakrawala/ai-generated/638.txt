The Minnesota Gophers have successfully secured the commitment of Martez Shabazz, a junior-college cornerback from Trinity Valley Community College in Texas. Originally, Shabazz had chosen Baylor University, but switched to Minnesota due to academic constraints.

Shabazz shared that Baylor University would not accept some of his lower grades, which meant he would have had to take additional classes to be eligible to play for the school. Unfortunately, financial limitations made that option unfeasible for Shabazz. He then contacted Minnesota, who gladly accepted his commitment.

Despite his academic challenges, Shabazz, known to be one of the fastest junior college defenders, expressed enthusiasm about joining the Gophers. Coach Jerry Kill envisions utilizing Shabazz's talents on blitzes and coverage plays, similar to LSU's Tyrann Mathieu. Shabazz is eagerly looking forward to proving himself and taking advantage of the opportunity to play in the Big Ten.

Coach Kill has a reputation for being cautious with junior college transfers, especially those who have faced academic issues. Nonetheless, it appears that he is willing to work with Shabazz to help him overcome his academic struggles. Though college coaches are unable to comment on recruits until they sign letters of intent, it seems that Kill is confident in Shabazz's abilities and potential. As such, he has communicated with Shabazz daily and even plans to visit him in Texas.

Minnesota will benefit from the addition of Shabazz, who brings his undeniable talent to a program that is eager to bounce back from a 3-9 season. Shabazz's journey with the Gophers is sure to be one worth watching.
