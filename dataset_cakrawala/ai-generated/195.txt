When Electronic Arts announced that DICE would be working on a new Star Wars game, the excitement was palpable. Sure, the publisher has produced some disappointing games in the past, but the prospect of a new Star Wars game from the team behind the excellent Battlefield series was enough to set any fan's heart racing.

Unfortunately, not every fan was happy with the result.

The first trailer for the game, which was unveiled at E3, was met with a largely positive response. However, the second trailer, which was released at Gamescom, was met with criticism from some quarters.

The trailer, which introduces the game's characters, was described as "cringey" and "embarrassing" by some fans.

Now, DICE has responded to the criticism, with general manager Oskar Gabrielson taking to Twitter to defend the trailer.

"We're making a game for the fans," he wrote. "We want it to feel authentic and real. That's our ambition. We will listen and we will learn but our commitment is true."

Gabrielson also shared a message from the game's creative director, Amy Hennig, who is best known for her work on the Uncharted series.

"I want to assure our fans that I, and the rest of the team at DICE, are absolutely committed to making a great game," wrote Hennig. "We are aware of the criticism and we are taking it to heart."

It's clear that DICE is aware of the concerns of its fanbase, and it will be interesting to see how the game responds to the criticism.

Star Wars Battlefront is set to be released in 2017.
