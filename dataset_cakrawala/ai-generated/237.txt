In the early 19th century, as the United States expanded into the lower South, white settlers encountered a problem. The area was home to several Indian nations, including the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chicasaw, and Seminole. These nations were seen as standing in the way of progress by the settlers, who were eager to raise cotton and pressured the government to acquire Indian territory.

Andrew Jackson, a forceful advocate for Indian removal, commanded U.S. military forces that defeated a faction of the Creek nation in 1814, ultimately acquiring 22 million acres of land in southern Georgia and central Alabama. In 1818, Jackson's troops invaded Spanish Florida to punish the Seminoles for harboring fugitive slaves, acquiring even more land.

From 1814 to 1824, Jackson played a crucial role in negotiating nine out of 11 treaties which divested the southern tribes of their eastern lands in exchange for lands in the west. These tribes agreed to the treaties to appease the government and protect themselves from white harassment. As a result of the treaties, the United States gained control over three-quarters of Alabama and Florida, as well as parts of Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, and North Carolina. While this was a period of voluntary Indian migration, only a small number of Creeks, Cherokee, and Choctaws actually moved to the new lands.

In 1823, the Supreme Court ruled that Indians could occupy lands within the United States but could not hold title to those lands. This was due to their “right of occupancy'' being subordinate to the United States' “right of discovery.” In response, the Creeks, Cherokee, and Chicasaw restricted land sales to the government to protect what remained of their land before it was too late.

While some Indian nations attempted non-violent methods such as adopting Anglo-American practices, adopting a policy of assimilation, or ceding portions of their land to the United States, others like the Creeks and the Seminoles waged war to protect their territory. The Cherokee tried legal means to safeguard their rights: they declared themselves a sovereign nation based on previous United States policy in 1827. In 1831, they appealed to the Supreme Court against the Georgia law, which prohibited whites from living on Indian territory without a license from the state. The court decided in favor of the Cherokee, but Georgia refused to abide by the decision and President Jackson refused to enforce the law.

In 1830, Jackson pushed the “Indian Removal Act” through Congress, giving him power to negotiate removal treaties. Under these treaties, Indians were to give up their lands east of the Mississippi in exchange for lands to the west. The act affected not only southeastern nations, but many others further north. While removal was supposed to be voluntary and peaceful, the southeastern nations resisted, and Jackson forced them to leave. Jackson's attitude toward Native Americans was paternalistic and patronizing, believing the removal policy was beneficial.

The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty in 1830, followed by other tribes. However, most resisted and were coerced into signing or faced the Second Seminole War. In the end, most tribes moved west, leaving behind only a few who had to defend themselves in the Third Seminole War.

While the Chickasaws saw removal as inevitable, the Creeks did not sign a removal treaty and resisted until 1837. The Chickasaws were forced to pay the Choctaws for the right to live on part of their western allotment, where they eventually migrated. The Indian Removal Act caused severe upheaval and forever changed the lives of the southeastern nations.
