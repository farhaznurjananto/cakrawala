Che Pope has played a significant role in my career, often sharing my work with influential artists like Kanye West. One day, I received a call from Che, informing me that Post Malone was at the Shangri-La studio in Malibu with Kanye, and I was invited to join them. As a huge fan of Kanye's work, I was initially starstruck at the idea of meeting him. However, upon entering the studio, I realized that Kanye was just an ordinary person, which put me at ease.

As we got to work, I focused on assisting Kanye in developing his project by exploring various samples and experimenting with new sounds. I chopped up the vocal sample slightly differently and played it over a high-pitched riser sound, followed by drums and synth bass combined with 808s. I even added a unique element - a microphone'd recording of a bicycle chain spinning and slowing down.

Working on Kanye's records can be quite competitive, as he often collaborates with various artists simultaneously. Despite the pressure, I was ultimately able to receive positive feedback from Rick Rubin, which was a great achievement for me.

There was also an amusing incident with Juicy J, who mistook me for a studio runner due to my appearance. When asked to fetch water and cookies, I clarified that I was there as a producer and that I didn't work for the studio. Although it was a minor misunderstanding, it provided a moment of comic relief in the studio environment. Overall, it was a fantastic experience working with these talented artists in refining their work and realizing their artistic vision.
