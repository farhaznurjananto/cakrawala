Scripts Scripts are an important part of Web sites. They add interactivity, animation, and other useful features to your site. This section introduces the basics of working with JavaScript on your site. Adding Scripts to Your Site Scripts are added to your site in the same way as any other content, such as HTML pages, images, and style sheets. However, because scripts are usually written in a text editor, you can just open your HTML document in your text editor and add the script. For example, if you have a basic HTML document named script.html, you can add a script in it by opening it in your text editor and adding the following: <body> <script> // JavaScript goes here </script> </body> This is a very simple script that does nothing. You'll learn how to write more useful scripts later in this section. The script tag is just like the other tags you've seen throughout the book. It has a start tag, which begins with an opening angle bracket (<) and the word script, and an end tag, which is identical to the start tag except that it has a slash (/) right before the word script. The JavaScript code goes between these two tags. This code is referred to as the script's contents. You can also include a document type declaration (DTD) if you want your script to be valid XML. The document type declaration for XML is <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that the script is an XML document. If you don't include this declaration, your script might not work correctly. You can also include an event handler declaration (HDR) if you want the browser to run a script when an event occurs on the page. The event handler declaration for JavaScript is <script src="event-handler.js"></script>. You'll learn more about event handlers later in this book. You can also include style declarations (SDR) if you want to apply styles to your script. The style declaration for JavaScript is <style> . </style> . You can also include a content type declaration (CTD) to declare the MIME type of the script. The content type declaration for JavaScript is <script type="text/javascript"></script>. This
