Title: Ballard Multimodal Corridor Update

Article:

The Ballard Multimodal corridor includes several transportation projects along NW Market St and Shilshole Ave NW, aiming to enhance accessibility and improve transportation efficiency. The proposed upgrades in the area include roadway paving, signal improvements, new transit poles, sidewalk construction, storm drainage improvements, and the completion of the Burke-Gilman Trail Missing Link.

The Ballard Multimodal Corridor will undergo improvements in two distinct phases - the Market and Shilshole phases. Construction on the Market phase, between the Ballard Locks and 24th Ave NW, will commence in mid-2019 and progress through the year. Utility verification for the Market Phase is set to begin in March 2019.

The utility verification work for the transit poles and signal improvements is expected to start in early March, concluding in May. One lane of NW Market St and NW 54th St will be closed for exploratory excavations during this period. The work will help determine potential locations for King County Metro transit poles and Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) signal poles, with some pavement removal and vegetation clearing required.

The Ballard Multimodal corridor comes as a result of consultations with various community stakeholders, focusing on creating a multimodal corridor along the Ship Canal between the Ballard Locks and 11th Ave NW. The upgraded infrastructure aims to benefit various road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and truck drivers. 

The extensive history of the Burke-Gilman Trail Project has involved extensive community outreach and environmental review processes to ensure that the improvements are well-suited to the needs of local residents. The project focuses on enhancing the safety and predictability for all road users, while promoting efficient usage of public funding through partnerships with other projects and agencies.

The construction of the Ballard Multimodal Corridor is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2020, with overall costs projected to be approximately $26.4 million. Funding for these improvements will come from a variety of partnerships and programs, combining efforts to provide a more efficient and safe transportation experience for the Ballard community.
