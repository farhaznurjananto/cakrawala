TORONTO - Intense animosity and relentless antipathy emanate from the city's streetcar tracks, which have vowed to persist until every one of Toronto's cyclists has been crushed, battered, or completely broken.

"We are streetcar tracks!" proclaimed the lifeless steel beams embedded in transit corridors across the city. "We are deeply affronted by the disrespect shown to us by these two-wheeled nuisances that fumble and scuttle across us like ill-coordinated road vermin. Our patience has worn thin. It's time to put a stop to this cyclist problem!"

"Take note that every time a cyclist traverses our path, they will regret it," they added ominously.

Several incidents aligned with the tracks' threats have been reported, with numerous cyclists ending up in the hospital after getting their wheels caught in tracks or being thrown over their handlebars.

Experts claim that this escalating tension is merely the latest episode in a lengthy struggle between the cyclists and the streetcar tracks in the area—a conflict dating back decades to when bicycles began intruding on territory traditionally held by streetcars, land they consider sacred.

"I was cycling down Broadview, keeping to myself," recounted Richard Thornsberry, a cyclist. "I reached Queen Street and suddenly, they were all around me. They had staged an ambush. The next thing I knew, I was in an ambulance with a fractured collarbone and three broken ribs."

"Frankly, it was enough to make me finally purchase a car," he added.

"(Streetcar) tracks refuse to acknowledge our right to exist," said cycling advocate Diana Greensboro, whose brother was recently hospitalized due to an altercation with a streetcar track. "The tracks are indiscriminate. They'll target anyone they can—whether young or old, seasoned or novice cyclists. They pose a serious danger!"

At the time of writing, the College and Bathurst intersection had turned into a bloody battleground for cyclists who failed to heed the warning issued by the streetcar tracks.
