The Atlanta Falcons are proud of their new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but there appears to be a crowd-flow issue. The Chick-fil-A Kickoff Games were held at the stadium during the first week of college football. Alabama and Florida State met Saturday night, and Tennessee and Georgia Tech met Monday night. Both games were exciting, but fans had a problem leaving the stadium after the game on Monday night. Many fans who were present and unable to leave took to Twitter to express their concerns and disappointment, using the Reddit Twitter account: It's terrifying getting out, and no one is allowed to use the escalators. pic.twitter.com/wBhAq4xo0O Cody Fortune (@CodyFortune) is a Twitter user. 5th of September, 2017 Getting out was a nightmare; it took me 30 minutes to squeeze out by going down a maze of stairs.

Fan safety is a top priority, and it appears that the stadium staff will need to address exit procedures.
