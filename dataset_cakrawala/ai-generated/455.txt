A joint study conducted by researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin, Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, and Archaeological Survey of India, has found that India's famous landmark, the Taj Mahal, is slowly turning brownish-yellow due to air pollution. The study states that the color change is caused by the deposition of dust and carbon-containing particles emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, biomass, and garbage.

The research findings could lead to targeted strategies to reduce air pollution in and around Agra, as well as the development of more effective ways to clean the marble surface of the iconic 366-year-old mausoleum, India's most visited man-made structure. Researchers analyzed air samples at the site and found high concentrations of suspended particles that could potentially discolor the monument's surface. The pollutants deposited on the marble were identified as 3% black carbon, around 30% organic carbon (or brown carbon), and the majority being dust.

Black carbon is emitted by vehicles and other machines that burn fossil fuels, while brown carbon is typically released through the burning of biomass and garbage, a common practice in the region. The study concludes that the deposited light-absorbing dust and carbonaceous particles are responsible for the surface discoloration of the Taj Mahal.

Since 2008, efforts have been made to mitigate the yellowing of the monument by using a clay pack treatment consisting of lime-rich Fuller's earth to clean the marble surface. Researchers now plan to study the efficacy of this method and explore ways to improve it, focusing on reversing the yellowing effect caused by air pollution.
