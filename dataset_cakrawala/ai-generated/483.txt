Chicago Cubs fans wanting to witness the team's historic post-World Series homecoming at Wrigley Field this season are being asked to pay premium prices for tickets. The asking price for tickets to the Cubs' home opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 10, their first home game since winning the 2016 World Series, currently averages $443 on TicketIQ, a secondary market ticket aggregator. This figure represents a 147% increase compared to the first home game one year ago, with the cheapest available seat listed at $116. TicketIQ founder Jesse Lawrence told FOX Business, "For Cubs fans who couldn't pay thousands of dollars to see their team in the World Series, Opening Day is a more affordable way to be a part of history."

The Cubs' victory over the Cleveland Indians in October 2016 brought the franchise its first championship since 1908 and generated the World Series' highest television ratings in 25 years. With MLB Opening Day just a month away, anticipation around this year's Cubs team is mounting.

The St. Louis Cardinals rank second on TicketIQ with an average asking price of $374 for their first home game on April 2, with the Cubs as their first opponent.

Although listed prices for Cubs tickets are significantly lower after the team's first home game, they remain higher than any other team in baseball. Throughout the season, Cubs seats have an average asking price of $186, followed by the Boston Red Sox ($164), the Texas Rangers ($160), the New York Mets ($148), and the Atlanta Braves ($108).

For fans searching for more economical options, the Colorado Rockies currently have the cheapest tickets on the secondary market. Seats at Coors Field in Denver have an average listing price of $52, while the Milwaukee Brewers ($60), Los Angeles Angels ($62), Arizona Diamondbacks ($62), and Houston Astros ($68) make up the bottom five.
