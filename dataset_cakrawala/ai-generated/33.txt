By Tesfa-Alem Tekle December 5, 2015 (ADDIS ABABA) – The second phase of the national dialogue has begun in South Sudan with a call for a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict.

The peace and reconciliation conference, which is being held in Juba, was opened on Friday by South Sudanese president, Salva Kiir, who called on the warring parties to cease hostilities and engage in dialogue.

“I urge all stakeholders to put the interest of our South Sudanese people first and work together to achieve peace and reconciliation,” he said.

In his speech, Kiir called on the warring parties to cease hostilities and engage in dialogue.

“I urge all stakeholders to put the interest of our South Sudanese people first and work together to achieve peace and reconciliation,” he said.

The South Sudanese leader also hailed the commitment made by the armed groups “to respect the ceasefire” and called on the warring parties to “commit themselves to peace”.

The conference, which follows a previous gathering held in the capital last month, was organised by the South Sudan Council of Churches, the African Union and the United Nations.

The conference is being held in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.

The participants include representatives from the SPLM-IO and the Riek Machar-led rebel coalition, as well as representatives from the government and the armed groups.

The second phase of the national dialogue is expected to last until the end of the year.

South Sudan has been engulfed in a civil war since 2013, when a conflict erupted between the government and an armed opposition alliance led by Riek Machar.

More than 1.5 million people have been displaced and over 5,000 killed in the conflict.

The conflict has also caused serious humanitarian conditions, with a lack of access to food, water and health services.

South Sudan is one of the world’s youngest countries and has been struggling to stabilise since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011.
