The upcoming Canadian federal election on October 19, 2015, has been touted as one of the most tightly contested in recent years, with volatile and uncommitted voters responsible for much of the uncertainty. According to the Angus Reid Institute's latest public opinion poll, almost one-fifth of the electorate say they will make their final decision either right before or on the election day. Amongst these influential undecided voters are a high number of younger Canadians who have proven to be fickle in previous elections. As expected, political parties have been focusing their campaigns on this demographic in a bid to sway their support.

The survey findings show that as the election campaign enters its final phase, the long-standing Conservative Party (CPC) holds steady at 33% of the decided vote, with the resurgent Liberal Party (LPC) at 31%, and the opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) at 25%. The data suggests a shift in soft support from the NDP to the LPC, with the CPC retaining its usual level of voter support from September. Despite the rising appeal of the Liberal party, younger Canadians tend not to vote as reliably as their older counterparts, who tend to turn out in higher numbers and support the Conservative Party.

The survey also shows that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau rates as the most appealing candidate amongst the three leaders, with 50% of those surveyed finding him appealing, compared to 45% for the NDP's Thomas Mulcair, and 34% for the Conservative's Stephen Harper. However, the Liberal party’s younger voting base is generally considered to be unreliable, and unlike their older CPC-supporting counterparts, many soft NDP supporters have yet to decide which party they will support in the election. Therefore, much of the election result will depend on how many young voters turn out to vote and whether the Liberals can convince soft NDP supporters that they offer the most viable alternative to Harper’s government.

While the survey suggests the possibility of the Conservative Party forming another government, eleven consecutive years in power in Canada is a rare feat. The Canadian electorate is expecting the upcoming election to be closely contested, with the winner likely to form a minority government. In fact, the survey found that fully 64% of Canadians who believe a particular party will win the election still see the winning party forming a minority government. However, the election is far from decided, and with almost one-fifth of voters still undecided at this stage, it remains to be seen which side will prevail come election day.
