For the first time, scientists have directly observed the formation of a molecular cloud and the birth of a star like the Sun.

The discovery was made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a powerful telescope in Chile.

The team of astronomers observed a young star, called MMS-1, as it formed in a molecular cloud.

MMS-1 is thought to be about 100,000 years old and is still surrounded by a disk of gas and dust.

The new observations, published in the journal Nature, offer a rare glimpse into the birth of a star and the formation of its planetary system.

"This is the first time we've been able to directly observe the formation of a star like our Sun," said lead author Lars Kristensen, of the European Southern Observatory in Chile.

"It's a key moment in the formation of planetary systems, and it's also a key stage in the formation of a star."

Kristensen and his colleagues used ALMA to study the star-forming region known as the Aquila Rift.

The Aquila Rift is a molecular cloud, a dense region of gas and dust, about 1,350 light-years from Earth.

MMS-1 is located in the heart of the Aquila Rift, and is being heated by the star's radiation.

The radiation is causing the gas and dust in the region to expand, and this process is known as "thermal conduction."

Kristensen's team observed the gas and dust being heated to temperatures of more than 1,800 degrees Celsius (3,100 degrees Fahrenheit).

This high temperature is what is responsible for the gas and dust becoming plasma – a hot and dense form of matter.

The team also observed the appearance of shocked gas – gas that has been ionized by the star's radiation.

This process creates radicals, or free radicals, which are key elements in the formation of stars.

"The formation of a star is a complex process, and this is the first time we've been able to see it happening in such detail," said co-author Carlos Labordena, also of the European Southern Observatory.

"It's an important step forward in our understanding of how stars and planetary systems are born."

ALMA is a collaboration between the European Southern Observatory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the University of Arizona.
