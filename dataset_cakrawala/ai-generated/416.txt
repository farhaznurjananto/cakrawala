Boise is about to join a host of other cities around the United States in welcoming bike share programs as Social Bikes, New York’s vendor, plans to introduce its three-speed cruiser bikes with adjustable seats, solar-powered GPS, a lock, bike lights, and even a basket in the city by March this year. Boiseans and bike lovers all around will have a chance to test the program before it officially launches in downtown Boise. The start-up also operates in seven other cities across the small American cities of Hailey, Idaho, Hamilton, California, and Providence, Rhode Island, among others.

The up-and-coming bike share program in Boise came after Boise Bike Share, in partnership with Social Bikes, reportedly signed an agreement last year. The company recently launched a pilot program in preparation leading up to the launch of the proper bike share program. The pilot program aims to test the efficacy of the bikes and to help resolve any issues before the official launch. Reports reveal that pop-up kiosks have been distributed all over the city, making available Social Bikes for Boiseans willing to test the program.

However, Boise's metropolitan neighbor, Portland, has hit a few bumps on the road towards launching their bike share program. Portland was originally planning to put in 75 stations, each with ten bikes before Alta's supplier had gone bankrupt last year. However, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) recently reported that they had to withdraw their funding application after a “false” sponsorship claim. According to the PBOT statement, they had indeed received the necessary sponsorship, but the false sponsorship claim had thrown a wrench in their initial timeline.

Despite this setback, the PBOT continues to work hard towards making Portland’s introduction of a bike share program a reality. The bureau has had clear and frequent communication with Oregon Department of Transportation staff throughout the process “…for development of the grant agreement and execution of the grant agreement.” commented the PBOT in a statement. With the right systems and partnerships, Portland aims to launch a successful and sustainable bike share program. They are currently reconsidering their timeline for the bike share program and may launch it later this year if all necessary requirements are met, which will be exciting news for Portlanders who will have more shared transportation options.
