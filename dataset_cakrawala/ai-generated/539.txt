The Post's investigative series brings attention to the controversial law enforcement practice of civil asset forfeiture. This allows officials to seize cash or goods from a person suspected of a crime, even if no charges are ever filed against the individual. Since 2001, $2.5 billion in cash have been seized from people who were never charged with a crime.

The above chart displays the inflation-adjusted dollar value of all Department of Justice asset forfeitures from 1989 to 2013. This includes both civil asset forfeitures, such as those featured in the Post's investigation, as well as criminal asset forfeitures, which involve property seized from defendants that have been formally accused of a crime.

The amount seized has experienced a dramatic increase, particularly during the latter half of the last decade. 2012 marks a peak, as approximately $4.6 billion worth of cash and goods were taken. The Department of Justice does not offer breakdowns distinguishing civil from criminal seizures before 2008, but data since then reveals that civil asset forfeitures have more than doubled, growing from $508 million in 2008 to $1.1 billion in 2013.

Numerous factors likely contribute to this escalation, with a significant component being the rise in post-2001 "stop and seize" traffic stops, as documented in the Post article.

Civil asset forfeiture laws place the burden of proof on asset owners, requiring them to show that their assets are unrelated to a crime, adhering to the preponderance of the evidence legal standard. In simple terms, individuals are considered guilty until proven innocent.

This process has sparked widespread controversy, leading to Senator Rand Paul introducing a reform bill this summer, followed by Michigan representative Tim Walberg.

Past reform attempts have faced strong opposition, predominantly due to intense lobbying from law enforcement groups, as asset forfeiture serves as a considerable revenue source for them. From a political standpoint, the practice is widely disliked. Liberals argue that it disproportionately affects poor and minority citizens, whereas conservatives view it as a severe overreach of state power.
