On December 12-14, 2014, Hamas celebrated the 27th anniversary of its founding. At a ceremony held on December 14 at the movement's headquarters in Gaza City, senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniya delivered a speech in which he said that the movement was continuing its struggle and would not accept any compromise or surrender, and that the Palestinian people would never agree to relinquish its right to return to its homes in the 1948 territories.

Expressing his solidarity with the Palestinians in the 1948 territories and the PA-administered territories, Haniya said that the unity of the Palestinian people was essential to the success of their struggle. He also condemned the U.S. and the West for supporting Israel and said that the Muslim world was required to support the Palestinians. He also condemned the Arab regimes that supported the U.S. and Israel, and emphasized that the Arab people would never accept this position.

In his speech, Haniya also condemned the Israeli arrest campaigns, the destruction of Palestinian homes and the Israeli policy of building Jewish settlements. He said that the Palestinians would never agree to relinquish the right of return, adding that the return of the refugees to their homes would never be dependent on Israeli permission. He also condemned the Israeli policy of Judaization, saying that it aimed to change the character of Palestinian towns and villages.

Hamas spokesmen have repeatedly called for the establishment of an Islamic state in the Palestinian territories, and they have rejected any negotiations or concessions that would lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In recent months, Hamas has increased its attacks on Israeli civilian targets, including the recent attack on a UN school in Sderot.

On December 7, 2014, the Israeli military carried out a series of airstrikes against a number of tunnels located in the Gaza Strip, which were used for the smuggling of arms and ammunition into the Palestinian territory. The Israeli military said that the airstrikes were carried out in response to a series of deadly terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations against Israeli civilians.

Hamas has rejected any involvement by its members in the terrorist attacks, and has called for an investigation into the allegations.

Hamas was founded in 1987, after the dissolution of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The movement is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., the EU, Israel, and many other countries.

Hamas is a radical Islamist organization that seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in the Palestinian territories, and its refusal to recognize the State
