Earlier this year, Logitech introduced the MX Master Wireless Mouse, highlighting its artisan craftsmanship and precise hand-sculpting. The company has now launched the MX Anywhere 2, featuring some of the same design elements, but in a few key differences.

The MX Anywhere 2 is considered the "mobile version" of the MX Master, containing the same Darkfield laser sensor for tracking on any surface, including glass. Users can pair the mouse with either Windows or Mac computers, using either Logitech's Unifying dongle or a standard Bluetooth connection. The Bluetooth pairing also allows users to connect with three devices simultaneously, switching between them using a button located at the bottom of the mouse.

Aesthetically, the MX Anywhere 2 has a less pronounced contour compared to the MX Master, offering smoother sides and a more conventional, symmetrical design. It features a similar, albeit smaller, thumb rest for right-handed users adorned with polygonal art like the MX Master, but exchanges the extra scroll wheel for a pair of buttons.

The MX Anywhere 2 also comes with a rechargeable internal battery that lasts up to two months at full charge and up to two hours after only a minute of charging. The new model is set to retail at $79.99, making it $20 cheaper than the MX Master. However, unlike its larger counterpart, there is no mention of the MX Anywhere 2 being "hand-sculpted", which could contribute to the price difference.
