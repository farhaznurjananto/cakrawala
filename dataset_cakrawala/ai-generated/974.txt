The head of the Lebanese delegation was reprimanded by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after several members of the delegation blocked Israeli athletes from boarding a bus. Leaders from the IOC informed the Israeli delegation at Rio that they had called Salim al-Haj Nakoula, the head of the Lebanese delegation, in for questioning. Nakoula was issued a stern warning by the IOC's upper echelons during the hearing that took place this week in light of the previous week's incident. Before Friday night's opening ceremony, the Lebanese delegation reportedly refused to ride a bus with Israeli athletes. Nakoula was warned by the IOC during the hearing that similar incidents would not be tolerated in the future. The Lebanese delegation chief defended himself by saying the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. Israeli sailing coach Udi Gal, who revealed the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, later said that the Israeli delegation had decided to move on and concentrate on the competitions despite the unpleasant incident. The Olympic Games are supposed to symbolize the polar opposite of this kind of thing, so it's impossible for this to happen in 2016, Gal said. 'Our bus was supposed to be shared with the Lebanese delegation and the doors were closed even before we arrived,' the sailing coach said. "We asked the organizers in Portuguese if we could load the bus, since it was our bus in the first place. We insisted, saying that nothing like this could actually be occurring. They told us the bus ride would be uncomfortable because the Lebanese delegation didn't want us there." According to Gal, the authority figure in charge had the driver open the door at gunpoint "When we tried to board, the head of the Lebanese delegation physically blocked the door. He and the other two volunteers wanted to physically stop us from boarding." Miri Regev, Israel's Minister of Culture and Sports, welcomed the IOC's decision. She said she was glad that people were speaking out against the anti-Semitic remarks made by the Lebanese delegation. "I anticipate that all anti-Semitic expressions and the exclusion of Israeli athletes from competitions around the world will be treated in the same spirit."
