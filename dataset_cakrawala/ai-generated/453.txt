Title: A Fair Look at the 2014 Godzilla Film

Rating: 7/10 | A Decent Addition to the Godzilla Franchise

Even though the 2014 Godzilla film falls short compared to classics like the 1954 original or Mothra vs. Godzilla, it still deserves praise. The visual effects impressively depict larger-than-life monsters, from their movements to their distinctive personalities. Infused with emotions like joy, love, despair, and wrath, each creature feels multidimensionalâ€”even the MUTOs, despite their unremarkable appearance. And of course, Godzilla retains his signature indestructibility and atomic breath.

The biggest drawback of the film, according to most fans, is the limited screen time given to Godzilla himself. Yes, other monster-focused movies like Jurassic Park, Aliens, Predator, and Jaws spend much of their runtime on human characters, but those films offer likable, well-defined characters that the audience can root for.

Unfortunately, in Godzilla, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's portrayal of Ford falls flat, lacking the stoic intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. The potential subplot of Ford harboring animosity toward Godzilla could have been compelling, but it remains unexplored. Similarly, Elizabeth Olsen's Elle fails to convincingly convey emotional anguish or concern for her patients and family. Bryan Cranston's Joe and Ken Watanabe's Sherizawa are also overshadowed by these two-dimensional leads.

The film's creators have a simple solution for future Godzilla entries: either give the iconic monster more screen time or hire better actors and flesh out the human characters to make them more memorable. Nevertheless, the 2014 Godzilla film remains an entertaining watch, and fans are eager for what the sequel has in store.
