Title: Rio de Janeiro's First Half of 2017 Witnesses Unprecedented Violence, Highest Rates Since 2009

On the afternoon of July 5th, a ten-year-old girl fell victim to a horrific tragedy in the form of a gunshot wound to the head in a favela, a slum located in the northern zone of Rio de Janeiro. In her devastating pain, her aunt, Tatiana Lopes, expressed her grief and frustration at the door of the Legal Medical Institute (IML). Blaming the public authorities for their inability to ensure the safety of citizens, her outcry quickly went viral, resonating with the sentiments shared by an increasingly fearful and distraught population.

In light of recent events and statistics, it is no wonder that the citizens of Rio de Janeiro are demanding change. Official data reveals a chilling upswing in the city's crime rates, with 3,457 violent deaths recorded in the first half of 2017 alone. This number marks a shocking 15% increase in such incidents compared to the same period in 2016, making it Rio de Janeiro's deadliest first-half since 2009, which saw 3,893 violent deaths.

Despite efforts to reinforce and maintain order with assistance from both the National Security Force and Armed Forces, these numbers signal that the city's law enforcement is struggling to keep up with the rapid surge in crime.

The Baixada Fluminense region, a densely populated metropolitan area consisting of 13 adjacent municipalities housing a combined 3.7 million inhabitants, has experienced the most significant increase in violent incidents with a startling spike of 23%. In this region, citizens feel particularly susceptible to violence and express grave concerns for the safety of their families and communities.

The data, obtained from the Public Security Institute (ISP) and reflecting its statistical analysis, includes instances of murder, robbery aggravated by death, bodily harm resulting in death, as well as casualties and homicides involving police intervention.

In the face of these devastating statistics, the public outcry for improved security measures and more effective law enforcement strategies has never been more urgent. The people of Rio de Janeiro seek a safer environment for themselves and their loved ones and remain hopeful that their voices will be heard and significant change will be brought about to prevent further loss of innocent lives.
