Obituary: Maurice Ravel (March 7, 1875 - December 28, 1937)

Maurice Ravel remains a key figure in 20th-century music, even though he was not part of any avant-garde movement. The prolific composer was a musical dandy, a wanderer from the pre-war world, with a brilliant and subtle intelligence, known for his successful grafting of two different musical manners to form a coherent style. Ravel's music was often assimilable to the public and other composers, but his sound and texture came from different schools and epochs, making his music always readily recognizable.

Ravel's musical roots lay in purely French soil, and the content of his music was in a direct line from Saint-Saëns, Massenet, and Fauré (his master). His techniques were heavily influenced by the Russians, whom he learned orchestration from, and foreign phrases picked up on his travels to exotic countries. His music was a blend of many styles, but he remained true to his French roots, even as he explored global musical styles.

Even though Ravel was often labeled as a revolutionary at the beginning of the century, the only real novelty in his music lay in its bitter-sweet flavor. He was a master of musical style, and the aptness and good taste of his work are unquestionable. Ravel refused to compromise his natural creativity and refused to adopt unfamiliar post-war ideas and methods. Although his eclecticism was purely superficial, he was continually able to create masterful new works.

Ravel was introduced to the pre-war Russian ballet ensemble by Diaghilev and was influenced heavily by their style. His later work showed influences from jazz music, which also spurred his creativity. As he had already exhausted the quality and quantity of possible drugs, the drug-addict in him would have almost certainly either reformed or ceased writing altogether had he lived longer. However, the fact that he died at a comparatively early age cut short this development.

Throughout his life, Ravel created works of all kinds, including chamber music, piano pieces, and orchestral works. Some of his most famous works were for piano, and his creation drew inspiration from the instrument's atmospherics, often interrupted by lyrical touches that brought out his personal style. Ravel's chamber music was less lyrical than his piano works, but still showcased his technical prowess. He created stunning orchestrations, which were marked by technical virtuosity, giving them a unique flavor.

Ravel's music has been famous amongst audiences for more than a century, and in death, he shall remain an immortal part of musical and cultural history as one of the most eminent composers of the 20th century. His legacy as a great composer will continue to inspire generations to come, and his works will continue to be enjoyed by millions of music lovers from around the world.
