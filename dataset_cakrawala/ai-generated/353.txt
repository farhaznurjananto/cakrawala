On April 24th, 2021, the Armenian Apostolic Church held a canonization ceremony to honor all Armenians who were murdered during the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, which took place over 100 years ago. The genocide is believed to have resulted in the deaths of between 1 million and 1.5 million individuals. It is considered one of the worst atrocities committed during World War I and is recognized as the first genocide of the 20th century.

During the canonization ceremony, the Armenian Church recognized the victims as collective martyrs, and did not disclose the names or total number of individuals that were canonized. This was a poignant moment for the Armenian people who have long sought official recognition of the events as genocide. The Armenian Church's canonization of the victims serves as a recognition and affirmation of the suffering experienced by these individuals.

The ceremony was held in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, and conducted by both Catholicos Karekin II of All Armenians and Catholicos Aram of the Great House of Cilicia. Numerous religious leaders from a range of Christian denominations, including the Coptic, Syrian, Ethiopian, Malankara, and Russian Orthodox Churches, were present for the occasion. The general secretary of the World Council of Churches and a representative from the Conference of European Churches also attended. This was a powerful demonstration of solidarity and support for the Armenian people.

The Armenian Church reinstated its rite of canonization for this ceremony since the last known canonization was in the 17th century. This reintroduction of the canonization rite was an important moment for the Armenian Church and the Armenian people. It showed the power of tradition and the importance of remembering and honoring the past. By reinstating the canonization rite, the Church affirms its commitment to recognizing and honoring the victims of the Armenian genocide.

The ceremony concluded with the ringing of 100 bells, symbolizing the start of the genocide in 1915. A one-minute moment of silence was observed nationwide, and many churches worldwide joined in to honor the victims. This moment of silence was a powerful reminder of the magnitude of the tragedy that occurred and the importance of recognizing and remembering the past.

Overall, this commemorative ceremony highlights the ongoing importance of remembering the Armenian genocide and recognizing the collective loss experienced by the Armenian people. It serves as a powerful symbol of remembrance and a call to action to prevent future atrocities. The canonization of the victims by the Armenian Church is an important step towards healing and reconciliation for the Armenian people and the world as a whole.
