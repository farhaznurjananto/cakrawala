Alberta Ferretti's new collection appears free-spirited and harkens back to the late 1960s and early 1970s. The bohemian lineup consisted of jumpsuits, crop tops, maxi dress, panama set, and low-rider pants. On the runway, romantic Greco-Roman floor length gowns looked stunning. Other shorter, but equally romantic dresses with crochet florals and leafy hemlines looked equally stunning. Washed-out jeans, jean skirts, and fringe vests were also available.
