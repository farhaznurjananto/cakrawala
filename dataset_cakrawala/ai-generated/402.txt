As carnival season approaches, many people are busy picking their costumes and preparing their favorite carnival treats. One such treat is the traditional Slovenian carnival doughnut, or pustni krofi. While they may seem daunting to make, with a good recipe and a little practice, even beginners can make delicious krofi.

This recipe for 25 krofi requires three sets of ingredients and a few kitchen tools. The first set includes 1 kg flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/3 tsp salt, and the zest of one lemon. The second set includes 1 dl rum, 1 dl sunflower oil, 2 whole eggs, 6 egg yolks, 100 g sugar, and 3 dl milk. The third set includes 1.5 cubes of yeast (60g), 2 dl milk, 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp sugar, and oil for frying.

To begin, warm 2 dl of milk to 30°C and mix in the sugar, flour, and crumbled yeast. Let this mixture rise. In a separate bowl, sift together the ingredients from the first set and set aside. In another bowl, mix together the ingredients from the second set and slowly add in the first and third sets until a sticky dough is formed. Knead the dough either by hand or with a mixer until it becomes a smooth ball. Let the dough rest for an hour in a warm place.

After the dough has risen, roll it out on a floured surface and tear off small pieces that weigh approximately 90g each. Use circular molds if desired to get even portions. Shape the dough pieces into balls and let them rest on a floured cloth or towel for 30 minutes. Flip each ball and let them rest for an additional 10 minutes.

Heat the oil in a pot or fryer to 160°C. Carefully place each dough ball into the oil, turning them over once they’ve floated to the surface. Once fried and cooled, inject each krof with your favorite jam and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

While this recipe may require some precision and patience, the result is a traditional Slovenian treat that is sure to impress. Whether you’re celebrating carnival season or just in the mood for something sweet, homemade pustni krofi are a treat worth trying.
