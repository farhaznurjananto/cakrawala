Article MEMBERS ONLY Brewing Session Beers: A Primer

A session beer is defined by the British as a beer that is low in alcohol, usually below 4% ABV. There are two main reasons for brewing a beer that is low in alcohol. The first is economic: a brewer can produce more beer for the customer at a lower cost. The second reason is practical: a customer can drink more of the beer before becoming intoxicated.

The main difference between a session beer and a traditional beer is that a session beer is typically lighter in color and has a lower alcohol content. A session beer can also be lower in bitterness and hops, which gives it a more drinkable quality.

When choosing a beer to make as a session beer, it is important to consider the intended audience. A session beer is best suited for people who want to drink fewer beers but still have a good time. A session beer is not meant for people who are looking for a heavy beer.

There are a number of different styles of session beers, but the most popular are light lagers. Some of the most popular light lagers for brewing as a session beer are Pilsner, Hefeweizen, and Belgian Wit.

One of the most important factors to consider when brewing a session beer is the malt flavor. It is important to use a light malt flavor to avoid creating a heavy beer. The other important factor to consider when brewing a session beer is the bitterness and hops. It is important to use a lower amount of bitterness and hops to avoid overwhelming the taste of the malt and hops.

Brewing a session beer is a great way to create a fun, low-alcohol beer that is perfect for a summer night. If you are interested in brewing a session beer, be sure to consult with a professional brewer to get the most accurate and consistent results. Brewing a session beer is an easy and fun way to add a unique and delicious flavor to your beer lineup. Be sure to experiment and enjoy the process!
