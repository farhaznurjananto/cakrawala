Hi guys! ðŸ™‚ If you follow me on Instagram (and you should be, ha!), you know that Iâ€™ve been in the kitchen lately. I love to cook and bake and thatâ€™s a rare thing for me to do. I used to have a ton of recipes posted on my blog but I just never have the time to bake a cake or make dinner anymore. Iâ€™m a pretty good cook and I like to experiment with different flavors and recipes. I always try to make my own version of recipes I find on cooking apps.

So today I want to share with you my latest creation. I made a lemon curd cake! The lemon curd is homemade (which I will share the recipe for in a future post) and the cake is a simple white cake. I used a simple recipe from the Food Network. I love the combination of the lemon curd and the white cake. Itâ€™s such a refreshing flavor.

I hope you all have a great weekend! ðŸ™‚

Allison
