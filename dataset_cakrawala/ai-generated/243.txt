River Rock Festival’s founder Jeff Wall sat down for an interview about creating an outdoor music festival in Northern Maine. With just over a week until the festival kicks off, Wall admitted that most of the major details are now in motion, saying he remains focused on coordinating volunteers for the festival to make sure everything runs smoothly. Wall said volunteers are critical to the success of a festival or concert. The founder of Lighthouse Christian Events, Wall, launched his business back in 2008 with a concert by Laura Story and has been going strong ever since. He revealed that putting on a festival is something they have always wanted to do, and it’s a natural extension of their previous work. However, he also admitted that creating a festival requires more effort and resources than producing a concert.

Wall was asked what distinguishes River Rock from other festivals, and he answered that quality plays an essential role. He aims to provide quality at an affordable price. He doesn't want attendees to experience any surprises on charges, like parking fees, surcharges, or special "autograph" costs. Instead, he wants to use a single flat-rate ticket that covers everything within their power. Wall believes it’s common in the concert industry to charge for everything and that attendees end up paying around double the price they think they will. He went on to say that he is guided by some set principles and longtime commitments not to make profits from the artists’ merchandise or other similar events. The Lord has honored his family’s decision, and they choose not to take any percentage of the artist’s sales.

Closing the conversation, Wall was asked whether he and his family would have a vacation after the event, and he replied that they like to treat events as vacations. He and his family get to travel to many places and treat those times as a vacation. Despite the stressful level of detail and schedules, Wall loves his work, and his business endeavors give him joy. The River Rock Festival is set for July 3 and July 4.
