On Friday, the University of South Carolina Board of Trustees approved a four-year contract extension for Gamecock men's basketball head coach Frank Martin. The contract, extending through the 2021-22 season, will begin at $2.45 million. Under Martin's leadership, South Carolina has consistently improved, with the team delivering one of the best season performances in its 108-year history in 2015-16. During that season, it set a record for regular-season wins (24) and matched the school record for wins in a season by achieving a 25-9 record.

Gamecock athletics director Ray Tanner expressed his enthusiasm about Martin's role as head coach, stating, "Frank has done an outstanding job with our basketball program at South Carolina, and I'm thrilled that he is our head coach." Tanner also praised Martin's dedication to academics and community outreach, acknowledging the basketball team's growth on and off the court during Martin's tenure.

Coach Frank Martin shared his excitement about the contract extension, saying, "My family, staff, and I are so excited that we will continue to call Columbia, South Carolina, home." He expressed his gratitude towards the players and their sacrifices in helping build the program, and confirmed his commitment to aiming for a championship basketball program for the Gamecock Nation.

Under Martin's four-year direction, South Carolina has seen consistent progress, with the pinnacle being the exceptional 2015-16 season when the Gamecocks began with a 15-0 record, their best start since the 1933-34 season. Additionally, Carolina completed its non-conference schedule undefeated and registered 11 SEC wins, the most league wins since 1998. Martin's guidance has also led the team to excel academically and contribute to the community through various outreach initiatives. Marking a five-semester streak with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, the men's basketball team set a program record for community service hours during the 2014-15 campaign.
