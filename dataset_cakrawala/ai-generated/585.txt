Indiana State University (ISU) Assistant Professor Arrested For Threatening Emails Targeting Muslim Community

An Indiana State University (ISU) assistant professor has been arrested for allegedly sending threatening emails to the Muslim community, causing considerable alarm on campus. Azhar Hussain, an assistant professor of aviation technology, has been charged with felony obstruction of justice and misdemeanor harassment. Furthermore, ISU has suspended Hussain from his teaching duties.

According to authorities, the charges relate to a series of anti-Muslim email threats sent to the university community. The first report of these alarming emails was received on March 8, with the messages appearing to specifically target Hussain. On March 24, Hussain claimed that he had been physically assaulted.

ISU Provost Mike Licari confirmed that Hussain was recently informed that his faculty position would not be renewed beyond the 2017-18 academic year, as he failed to fulfill the conditions of his original appointment. 

ISU Police Department Chief Joseph Newport explained that the evidence gathered during the investigation suggests Hussain was attempting to gain sympathy by portraying himself as a victim of anti-Muslim threats that he had created. Newport expressed regret for the unnecessary worry caused among members of the ISU community as a result of this situation.

The investigators involved in the case were able to successfully identify the source of the email threats and gather sufficient evidence to charge Hussain. The campus police received support from the Cybercrime and Investigative Technologies section of the Indiana State Police and an ISU information technology engineer. The collaborative effort underlines the importance of maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the university community.
