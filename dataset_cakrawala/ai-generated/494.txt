In a recent interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Rep. Michele Bachmann expressed her dissatisfaction with losing her health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. She discussed how, before this change, her family was content with their previous health insurance. However, she now claimed she was frustrated with the current situation.

During her conversation with Democratic strategist Paul Begala, Bachmann was asked whether she had considered exploring the Washington, D.C. health insurance marketplace to see how Obamacare might actually benefit her family. The Congresswoman responded that she had no intention of wasting her time on an online system that had experienced technical difficulties and frustrated many users.

Bachmann's frustration with her loss of coverage highlighted the fact that many people have had their insurance policies canceled due to Obamacare, but this situation obscures an essential detail: the decisions taken by her own Republican colleagues played a pivotal role in her predicament. 

The measure that compelled members of Congress to relinquish their existing employer coverage, provided by the federal government, and switch to the Obamacare insurance marketplaces for new plans, was initially a Republican proposal. This tactical decision by the Republicans was originally designed as a 'poison-pill' to put Democratic lawmakers in a bind. 

The proposal, also known as the Grassley amendment, came about through an amendment offered by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) while an early version of the Affordable Care Act was still in committee. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) did the same in a separate committee. Grassley's name ultimately stuck to the amendment because he continuously advocated for the policy while the law was being debated. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eventually included the policy, using language closer to Coburn's version, in the final bill that combined versions from the two Senate committees. The policy became law in 2010.

Despite the critical role her party played in her current health insurance issue, Bachmann failed to address this nuance during her interview. Instead, she chose to emphasize her reluctance to engage with the online health insurance marketplace until its problems had been resolved.
