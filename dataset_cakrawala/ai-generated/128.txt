Bennu travels around the sun at a speed of 0.00068 km/s.

It takes Bennu approximately 2680 seconds to complete one full orbit around the sun. Bennu's orbit is inclined by 5.88 degrees to the ecliptic plane. Bennu's orbital period is 1,461.1 days. Bennu's distance from the sun is 0.00158 AU. Bennu's average orbital speed is 0.00068 km/s. Bennu's orbit takes it through the asteroid belt, near the orbit of Mars, and through the Kuiper Belt. Bennu is currently in the constellation Virgo. Bennu's orbit will take it past the sun again in 2126. 

Bennu is currently the ninth largest object in the solar system. Bennu is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old. Bennu's diameter is approximately 1,000 km. 

Bennu is currently the subject of a study by the European Space Agency to explore the possibility of using it as a base for a manned mission to Mars. 

Bennu was discovered on October 18, 1999, by the Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LNEAR) team using the Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LNEAR) telescope at Apache Point, New Mexico.

Bennu's name is derived from an ancient Egyptian god, Bennu. In ancient Egyptian religion, Bennu was a god of the moon, and was considered to be the patron god of sailing and navigation. The name Bennu is also the name of an asteroid discovered in 1884 by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth. 

The name "Bennu" was submitted to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) by the LNEAR team in February 2000. The IAU accepted the name in October 2000. Bennu is the first planetary name from ancient Egyptian religion to be given to a planet.
