In what will come as a shock to no one who has followed the ongoing court battle over the Trump administration's efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Supreme Court on Friday stayed a lower court order that had prevented Trump from ending DACA while the administration attempts to defend the policy in court.

The court's order provides a stay of the District Court's order until such time as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals renders its decision in the case, setting a deadline of February 18, 2019.

The ruling was issued without comment from the court, although Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a dissent against the court's decision.

"It is hard to say what is more troubling: that the Government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the Court would grant it," Sotomayor wrote.

The suit against Trump's decision to end DACA was filed by the University of California, which challenged the Trump administration's decision to end the program. Trump had announced his decision to end DACA in September, but it was delayed until March 5.

The decision to end DACA was based on the fact that it was allegedly created by the Obama administration without Congressional approval and was therefore illegal.

The Trump administration has said that it will give a six-month window to Congress to come up with a legislative solution to the program, but there is little indication that any such solution is forthcoming.

In a separate development on Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration will end the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, which allows undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to remain in the country and work.

The program, which has been in place since 2012, is also set to expire on March 5. Sessions said that the "law is clear" that the program "cannot be implemented" and that it is instead "a magnet for illegal immigration."

Sessions said that the Trump administration is "committed to advancing the President's agenda of economic growth, jobs, and security" and that the decision to end DACA and DAPA "will help ensure that these programs are lawfully implemented and reflect the best interests of American families."

The decision to end DACA and DAPA comes as a major blow to the immigrant community and to progressive activists, who had hoped that the Trump administration would be more sympathetic to their plight.
