BAGHDAD — Frustrated by the Bush Administration's ongoing reluctance to provide a timetable for withdrawal, U.S. troops stationed in Iraq have developed their own exit strategy.

Staff Sgt. Cornelius Woods stated, "My marines are the best-trained, best-equipped, and most homesick fighting force in the world. Grant us the order, and we will swiftly commandeer every available vehicle to execute a successful flanking maneuver on the airstrips of Mosul. In no time, we will return to our families' dinner tables, completely devoted."

In defiance of the Pentagon and the White House's claims about the impracticality and impossibility of a rapid exit, soldiers of different ranks have outlined a clear-cut plan for immediate disengagement, dubbed "Operation Screw This."

Maj. Brian Garcia, on his third tour of duty in Iraq, shared, "We examined various withdrawal scenarios in our barracks but ultimately agreed on the notion of getting out of here as soon as possible."

Iraq war supporters argue that rebuilding the politically and economically devastated nation will take decades and the gradual departure process will only begin after a long-term occupation.

Army Spc. Megan Beaulieu responded to this argument, stating, "Though I am familiar with the 'years of occupation to facilitate reconstruction' theory, almost every soldier I know—including myself—considers the Dutch and Spanish approach of 'we've done all we can here, let's move out' more plausible." She added that if Apache helicopters rendezvoused with them in Fallujah and they left their supplies behind, they could be out of Iraq within 15 minutes.

Capt. Barry Graves of the Maryland National Guard, a Vietnam veteran who carries shrapnel in his leg from Khe Sanh, pointed out his past service in South Korea and Germany and questioned, "Is it time to go home yet?"

A recent ABC News poll showed that the American people are divided on the exit strategy. However, a University of Baghdad survey found that approximately 99.3 percent of the Iraqi population supports the plan.

"If the real reason we're here is to let the Iraqis run their own country, I have the perfect solution: my return to St. Louis," Pfc. Barbara Terland said.

Pfc. David Wareham, inspired by the unilateral policies of the White House, came up with his own unilateral strategy: "My exit strategy is beautifully simple. It involves me personally getting out of here the first chance I get. If I do that, I might be able to get back to my year-old son, whom I have never met. If that doesn't work, I'll resort to Plan B, which is to retreat into complete insanity."

U.S. Army Chief of Staff Peter J. Schoomaker announced that he and the commander-in-chief are evaluating the situation and strategizing the most effective way to bring the troops home safely.

Pfc. Terland suggested they publicly debate the withdrawal, saying, "If the chief of staff is genuinely interested in ideas for exiting Iraq, why don't we fly home to Washington and discuss it together over a cup of coffee?"
