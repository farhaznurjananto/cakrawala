If you've been reading my blog for a while, you may have noticed that I'm always interested in Neandertals. I have a Google alert set up for "Neandertal" to help me keep up with the latest scientific findings about these mysterious relatives of ours (and the alternate spelling, "Neanderthal"). I'm always happy to get an email telling me that there's a new story about our closest relative for me to read. Only one thing is wrong: almost half of the time, the story isn't even about Neandertals. The word seems more like an insult thrown at a politician or other person the writer dislikes. Neandertals are like Rodney Dangerfields of the human family: they don't get any respect. Even though there is more and more evidence that our ancient cousins hunted well, made beautiful stone tools, were kind to each other, and buried their dead, among other advanced behaviors, the word "Neandertal" is still used as a derogatory term. Neandertals are still looked down upon, even though it was found a few years ago that most people today have their DNA because Neandertals and modern Homo sapiens slept together a long time ago. Now, an amazing new find shows that it's time to bring Neandertals in from the cold. Researchers have found signs on eagle claws from a well-known Neandertal site in Croatia that show Neandertals took the claws and used them as jewelry. Such evidence points to the ability to think in symbols, which has long been thought to be a trait of modern humans. In a paper that came out March 11 in PLOS ONE, Davorka Radovi of the Croatian Natural History Museum in Zagreb, David Frayer of the University of Kansas, and their colleagues talk about the find. This isn't the first time someone has found proof that Neandertals used raptor claws. Researchers have already written about Neandertal talons that were found on their own at several sites in Europe. But at the Krapina site in northern Croatia, eight talons from at least three white-tailed eagles were found in a new find. The talons look like they were made by people, not by animals trampling on them, because they have cuts and polished edges. The researchers think that the talons were tied together with string or sinew and were part of a single piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace. What makes this find even more important is that it was made a long time before modern-looking Homo sapiens arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago. Many of the finds that seem to show Neandertal symbolism came from the time when Neandertals and modern people lived together in Europe. This leaves open the possibility that Neandertals just copied the newcomers or that modern things got mixed up with Neandertal remains. But the Krapina assemblage was made about 130,000 years ago, which is tens of thousands of years before people from the modern world came to Europe. If Neandertals were making jewelry there, it can't be said that they were influenced by people today. They must have thought of this way to use symbols on their own. In the end, these decorations add to the million-dollar question of whether or not Neandertals had language, since both art and language depend on being able to think in symbols. Archaeologists used to think that symbolic thinking and other parts of what is called "behavioral modernity" only appeared in the last 50,000 years or so and only in people with modern bodies. But early modern human sites in Africa have found signs of symbolic behavior that is much older than that. The fact that Neandertals decorated their bodies (and their cave homes) suggests that both Neandertals and modern people got this ability to think in symbols—and, by extension, language—from an even older common ancestor. Check out my feature article in the February 2015 issue of Scientific American for more on how Neandertals thought.
