Player Attitudes and Expectations in Casual vs. Competitive Play In addition to being an avid tournament player, I also help run my local club and am frequently called upon to teach new players the game. I wanted to use that experience to discuss competitive vs. casual gaming. To begin, let us distinguish between competitive and casual play. Tournaments, competitive events, and games specifically agreed upon to be practice for those are all examples of "competitive" play in this article. The rest will be "casual" play. Those are fairly broad, but I frequently see them defined in this manner elsewhere. Both of these games, and the difference between a good and bad experience in either of them, are dependent on managing the expectations and attitudes of both (or more) players involved. Expectations for competitive play are simple to define. Both players want to win, and you shouldn't enter a tournament without understanding that you might get a bad matchup or play against a very good player who kicks your a$$ six ways to Sunday. I don't like it when competitive players are shamed for taking a list that's "too cheesy" or "uses unfluffy units" to a tournament. The goal is to win, and it is reasonable for anyone attending an event to bring their best effort. Player attitudes are the most difficult aspect of competitive gaming to manage because you may face an opponent who is rude, tries to cheat, plays horribly slowly, or throws a temper tantrum. Fortunately, this is what TOs are for, and the best way to mitigate how bad a bad opponent can be is to call a TO over and let them know what's going on. The majority of your tournament experience will be determined by your attitude and the luck of the draw in terms of who you face. Defining expectations for casual games is where I believe many players fail and have a negative experience. Some people prefer to play with whatever models are on their shelf, or even only those that have been painted. They make a list and then use it. Other players, like myself, are compelled to ensure that their list is a "good" list. I frequently use bad units (I adore Vanguard Veterans), but will equip and support them within the list to ensure they have a job to do and can hopefully complete it. This is a difficult expectation to manage because both players are constructing what they consider to be a "casual" list. The only way to deal with this is to ask the second group of players to tone down their lists, or perhaps to assist their opponent in writing a list if their opponent wants to bring a better army. Also, try putting that person at a disadvantage (with their permission, of course) to make the game and matchup more interesting. In casual games, managing attitudes is simple. If a player is consistently difficult to play with for whatever reason, simply avoid them. The advantage of casual games (and tabletop games in general) is that you can always choose who to play with and when to play. If you feel like you need to play with someone with a bad attitude, talk to them. I've had plenty of bad games with otherwise good guys because they were having a bad day. So, what happens when these two intersect? Actually, nothing out of the ordinary. Many competitive players will fall into the second category of casual play and may require a disadvantage to ensure a fun game. Trying out a new army or a drastically different list is a significant disadvantage. Also, as a casual player playing with more competitively minded friends, don't immediately blame their attitude and list as the reason for a difficult game. Many people believe that tournament players all have a "Win at All Costs" mentality, which means they will always stomp you in an unfun way. I believe this is often due to competitive players simply being better players and the casual player looking for an excuse. Talk to them if you didn't enjoy the game. Perhaps they can narrow down their list, or point out a few instances where you could have simply played better to bring the game closer. Finally, let me address "That Guy" briefly. When most people complain about having a bad experience with a competitive player, I believe they are referring to those who bring an overly competitive list and/or attitude to a casual game. Even when you were clear the game was casual, they brought a top-placing tournament list they pulled off the internet, and act like a jerk or talk down to you all game. There isn't much you can do about this type of person except avoid playing with them. In my experience, these are usually middle/lower-tier tournament players looking to boost their ego by smacking around other people's fluffy armies. The very good tournament players who I've encountered have all been friendly and enjoyable people to play with
