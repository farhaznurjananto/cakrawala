A federal election forum in downtown Winnipeg brought about a heated confrontation between NDP incumbent Pat Martin and Green Party candidate Don Woodstock. The event took place on Wednesday in front of a full house, and the two candidates were grilled on their records and campaigns for improving infrastructure, fighting poverty and crime, helping those with addictions and mental illness, promoting human rights, and building affordable housing. The debate became controversial when Woodstock asked Martin how often he helps people with serious mental health issues outside his constituency office in Winnipeg's inner city. Martin became agitated and accused Woodstock of insulting his staff, and was later heard cursing at him while the Green candidate was responding. Woodstock has called for an apology and for Martin to be removed from the party, while both the Liberal Candidate Robert-Falcon Ouellette and the Communist Party of Canada's Darrell Rankin participated, and the Conservative candidate Allie Szarkiewicz was not present.
 
Many of the jabs during the forum were aimed at Martin's connection to the riding, with several comments stating that Woodstock was the only candidate who actually lived in Winnipeg Centre. Martin became more aggravated when Ouellette, whose campaign has put a focus on Martin's Salt Spring Island residence in British Columbia, was mentioned. Martin defended himself and criticized Ouellette for not being from or having genuine connections to the inner city, stating that “it looks like Calgary” to him. Ouellette promised to spend seven days a week working in Winnipeg Center if elected. Woodstock stated that he is a viable alternative and that he has done more for the community than Martin has in the past 18 years.
