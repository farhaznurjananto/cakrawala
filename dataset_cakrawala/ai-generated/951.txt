IQ scale What is the IQ test used to measure? What is a typical score? How high can IQ scores go? Here are some responses to these questions and others. Initially, the notion of IQ was either created in 1912 by the German psychologist and philosopher Wilhelm Stern or in 1916 by Lewis Terman, depending on the source you examine. Before either of these dates, intelligence testing was conducted on a significant scale for the first time. In 1904, the French government commissioned the psychologist Alfred Binet to develop a test to distinguish between intellectually normal and substandard children. The IQ scale known as the "Binet Scale" (and later the "Simon-Binet Scale") was derived from Binet's research. Later, the term "intelligence quotient" or "IQ" entered our lexicon. Terman improved the Simon-Binet IQ Scale and released the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale in 1916. (also known as the Stanford-Binet). The resulting scale for classifying IQ scores is as follows: IQ Scale Above 140 - Genius or practically genius 120 - 140 - Extremely superior intelligence 110 - 119 - Excellent intelligence 90 - 109 - Average or average intellect 80 - 89 - Dullness 70 - 79 - Borderline impairment in intellect Under 70 - Feeble-mindedness Distribution Normale des Cotes IQ 50% of IQ scores range from 90 to 110 70% of IQ scores range from 85 to 115 95% of IQ scores range from 70 to 130 99.5% of IQ values range from 60 to 140 Low IQ and Mental Deficit A quotient of intelligence below 70 is called "mental retardation" or poor mental capacity. In IQ tests, 5% of the population scores below 70. Typically, the severity of mental retardation is divided into four levels: 50-70 - Mild mental retardation (85%) 35-50 - Moderate mental retardation (10%) 20-35 - Severe mental retardation (4%) IQ 20 - Severe intellectual disability (1%) Superior IQ & Genius IQ A genius or near-genius IQ begins at approximately 140 to 145. Fewer than one-fourth of one percent belong to this category. Below are some popular IQ scale designations: 115-124 - Over average 125-134 - Gifted 135-144 - Extremely gifted 145-164 - Genius 165-179 - High genius 180-200 - Highest genius
