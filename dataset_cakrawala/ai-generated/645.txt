Cell-site simulator technology, often referred to by the brand name StingRay, is a rectangular device roughly the size of a suitcase that mimics cellphone towers and intercepts nearby phone signals. These devices have the capability to capture texts, calls, emails, and other data. However, law enforcement officers claim that the technology does not allow them to intercept the content of conversations, eliminating the need for an eavesdropping warrant.

A few years ago, the police department introduced a policy requiring officers to demonstrate probable cause when applying to use cell-site simulators, exceeding the standard order requirements. However, civil rights attorneys argue that in practice, the department typically utilizes a lower standard of reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause.

Prosecutors in New York rarely acknowledge the use of cell-site simulators, leaving defendants unaware and preventing defense attorneys from raising challenges. Some states, such as California, have attempted to mandate police agencies to obtain approval from their city councils before using the devices. In Baltimore, where cell-site simulators have been used extensively by the police, defense attorneys seeking details about the devices have led to prosecutors dropping charges to avoid answering questions. The Department of Justice now requires federal agents to obtain a warrant from a judge before using the devices, with few exceptions.

The use of cell-site simulators is on the rise, with the American Civil Liberties Union identifying 72 law enforcement agencies in 24 states and the District of Columbia that employ the technology. In New York, the Legal Aid Society has trained lawyers to recognize signs that a cell-site simulator was used, such as a suspect's cellphone suddenly dying or an abrupt arrest in a previously unidentified location. The Legal Aid Society states that a recent case in Brooklyn marked the first known instance in which New York City prosecutors informed defense attorneys about the approval to use a cell-site simulator, a fact that only came to light after persistent questioning.
