Anxiety disorders are a widespread and debilitating condition that annually costs society billions of dollars. These disorders arise as a result of fear memories, which enable previously neutral stimuli to become associated with traumatic events. The amygdala, a region of the brain, has been established as key in the mechanism of fear memory formation and is found to be hyperresponsive across anxiety disorders. While pharmacological and behavioral treatments can significantly reduce anxiety, relapses frequently occur. However, fear memories can be weakened or even erased by reactivating them and then preventing their subsequent reconsolidation.

Studies in rodents have found that extinction of fear conditioning within a specific reconsolidation interval can permanently attenuate the fear memory. Researchers led by Agren et al. sought to determine whether disrupting reconsolidation could also have a similar effect on fear conditioning in humans. They recruited 22 subjects who underwent fear conditioning on the first day through pairing a neutral stimulus with an aversive one. On the second day, a cue was presented as a reminder of the conditioned fear, and then the subjects were randomized into two groups. The first group received extinction training 10 minutes after the cue, within the reconsolidation interval, while the second group received extinction training six hours after the cue, outside of the reconsolidation interval.

On the third day, the subjects underwent a renewal session in a new environment to test for the return of fear. On the fifth day, subjects were exposed to unsignaled shocks, and the cue was presented again to test for the potential return of fear. Autonomic fear reactions, such as skin conductance responses (SCRs), were measured throughout the experiment.

The study found that the group that received extinction training within the reconsolidation interval showed no return of fear on the fifth day, while the group that received extinction training outside of the interval did. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify neural activity in the basolateral amygdala, a brain area connected to fear circuits, during the experiment. They discovered that, after reactivation and reconsolidation, a memory trace was evident in the basolateral amygdala that predicted subsequent fear expression and correlated with activity in the wider fear circuit of the brain.

The study also found that, while extinction training alone did not change the memory trace in the amygdala, extinction training within the reconsolidation window resulted in the erasure of the fear memory trace in the amygdala and weakened the connection in the wider fear circuit of the brain. This study supports the idea that the behavioral disruption of reconsolidation is dependent on the amygdala, as has been found in rodents, and suggests an evolutionarily conserved memory-update mechanism.

In conclusion, the study provides evidence that disrupting the reconsolidation of fear memories through extinction training within a specific time window can permanently weaken or even erase the memory trace in the basolateral amygdala and attenuate the connection in the wider fear circuit of the brain. These findings have significant implications for the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders, as they suggest a potential for long-lasting treatment efficacy.
