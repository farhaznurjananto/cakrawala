The Netherlands Declares National Day of Mourning for MH17 Victims

On Thursday afternoon, a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane crashed in the east of Ukraine, killing all 173 people aboard. The Netherlands, which suffered the most casualties with around two-thirds of the victims on board the plane being Dutch, declared a national day of mourning on 23 July, 2014.

According to an emergency worker at the crash site, over 100 bodies have been found, and the debris had spread over a 15 kilometre area. The cause of the crash is still under investigation. However, it is believed that the plane was shot down by a missile, causing the tragedy.

Malaysia Airlines is planning to fly victims’ relatives to the crash site near Donetsk, where they will be able to pay their respects to their loved ones.

Passengers scheduled to fly from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport to Kuala Lumpur shared their concerns about the tragedy. One passenger said they had originally booked to fly on the downed flight, but they had fortunately decided to change their travel date. Another passenger expressed their fear of flying and stated that today’s journey would be a time of prayer for them.

In response to the tragedy, Malaysia Airlines has decided to avoid Ukrainian airspace for its future flights between Schiphol and Kuala Lumpur. Some other airlines had already changed their flight paths months ago as a safety precaution, despite no restrictions being in place over Ukraine.

The MH17 crash is a tragic reminder of the dangers of air travel and the importance of taking necessary safety precautions. The world stands in solidarity with the victims and their families during this difficult time.
