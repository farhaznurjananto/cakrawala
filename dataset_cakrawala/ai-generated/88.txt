"Ask TriMet" answers some of the questions that riders, drivers and pedestrians want to know about public transportation in the Portland metropolitan area, but didn't know who to ask.

The Portland Tribune is happy to print these questions and TriMet's answers. To help improve the "Ask TriMet" feature, the Tribune will recognize a rider, driver or pedestrian from time to time with a free one-month TriMet pass.

Questions and answers may be edited for length and clarity.

Q: I read a recent story about TriMet's new program for seniors who have a disability that prevents them from using the bus or train, but allows them to drive.

Isn't there a program now that allows seniors with disabilities to ride for free?

A: Yes, the program has been around for a long time, but it doesn't allow seniors to ride for free.

The program is called the Senior Citizen's Disabled Transportation Assistance Program, or SCDTA, and it provides a $25 monthly pass for seniors with a disability that prevents them from using the bus or train.

The pass can be used on any of TriMet's bus or train lines, and can be used for an unlimited number of rides.

For more information about the SCDTA program, call 503-238-3200 or visit tri-met.org/seniors.

Q: I live close to a MAX station, but I don't ride the train because it's too expensive. Can I use the bus instead?

A: Yes, you can use the bus instead.

TriMet operates a bus rapid transit system called MAX, which provides fast, frequent service between downtown Portland and several suburban areas.

The MAX system is free to use for passengers with a valid TriMet ticket.

For more information about the MAX system, call 503-238-3200 or visit tri-met.org/MAX.

Q: I've heard that TriMet is planning to build a new light rail line that will run through my neighborhood. What can I do to help support the project?

A: You can support the project by signing up for updates about the project, or by attending one of the community meetings that will be held to discuss the project.

For more information about the project, call 503-238-3200 or visit tri-met.org/newline.
