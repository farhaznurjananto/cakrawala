The Baltimore riots in 2015 highlighted a significant political and social divide between the far left and everyone else. The left blamed the riots on social issues such as unemployment, lack of transportation, and payday loan businesses, but writers on the right refuted this narrative. The right agreed the precipitating event was the mysterious death of a young Black man, Freddie Gray, who died while in police custody. However, both sides disagreed on the inevitability of the riots. The left argued that the riots were the result of social and economic hardship, while the right saw the riots as a result of a lack of law enforcement. 

Some outlets, like Slate, who believe spanking is child abuse and personal responsibility is out of fashion, attempted to explain the looting away as a social phenomenon. Writers such as Abraham Miller at National Review disagreed and wrote that riots, like all forms of political and social violence, require mobilization, and mobilization requires leadership. Spontaneity is one of the great myths about social events.

The debate between the left and the right begins and ends with how they interpret the precipitating event. The left blames the riots on poverty and unemployment, but the right sees it as a failure of law enforcement to address crime or react decisively to the riots. Meanwhile, businesses, like payday lenders and check-cashing businesses, were destroyed, but they are not responsible for the unrest in underserved communities. However, the left viewed the lofters as avengers of social justice. 

Political correctness seems to have been a part of the problem in Baltimore, with politicians unwilling or unable to deploy force against young Black males during a time of unrest. In the end, the right concluded that this burning and looting was not a social issue, but a moral one, and that law enforcement needed to enforce the law regardless of race if society was going to improve. The debate continues as to the root causes of the unrest, but one thing is sure: to prevent further riots or looting, authority figures need to act decisively to prevent or end unlawful and violent behavior.
