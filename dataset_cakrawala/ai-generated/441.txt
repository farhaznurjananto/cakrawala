Former Minneapolis mayoral candidate, Mark Andrew, was brutally attacked by two teenage girls after his iPhone 4S was stolen at Starbucks in the Mall of America. Andrew, 63, is sure he was targeted because his phone was out, and he was presumed to be “easy pickings”. The former Hennepin County Commissioner had just finished hanging up the phone when a young man snatched his iPhone off the table – the theft led to Andrew being beaten over the head with a billy club by two teenage girls. Andrew’s willingness to pursue the phone thief led to a beating that left him bloodied and requiring nine stitches to his head. One of the attackers also used her fingernails to gouge Andrew’s face, while screaming: “I'm going to kill you! Let me go or I'm going to kill you''. This violent assault, which was witnessed by hundreds in the busy Starbucks, took about five minutes for police to arrive, and ended when the teenagers were arrested. Andrew was saddened that none of the hundreds of shoppers felt compelled to intervene, citing that it was a “sad commentary” on society. 

Police took both teen girls into custody but failed to find the man who originally stole the phone, leading shoppers to return it to Andrew. 18-year-old Letaija Shapree Cutler-Cain was taken to Hennepin County Jail and charged with one count of second-degree assault and two counts of first-degree aggravated robbery. Her first court hearing is set for Monday. The unnamed 17-year-old was also arrested for the attack. Cutler-Cain told police that she and her accomplices cased Starbucks throughout the day to see if it was a good spot to steal from customers. 

Following the assault, Andrew received nine stitches at Fairview Southdale Hospital, where he also had bruises and abrasions on his face. The assault has not deterred him from staying involved in the case against the two teenage girls who beat him up. Andrew’s longtime ally, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has endorsed Andrew for Mayor and issued a statement that these two attackers would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
