The American currency is set to get a fresh look as the US Treasury Department replaces the face on the $10 bill with a "notable woman." The department had organised a poll asking people to vote on which prominent woman of history they would like to see depicted on the new note. The poll was arranged by the women's advocacy group, Women on 20s. Harriet Tubman, the legendary abolitionist, came out on top with 50,000 votes. The former first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, who served as wife of President Franklin Roosevelt, and Rosa Parks, an activist in the civil rights movement, were also on the shortlist.

The US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says that bills are a good way to represent American values and that new $10 bills will be available featuring the woman's face, while still keeping the image of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton was one of the founding fathers of the United States, an important figure in shaping America and a subject of a popular Broadway musical.

The Treasury Department originally planned to replace Andrew Jackson's portrait on the $20 bill with a womanâ€™s portrait, but eventually decided to keep Jackson on the front of the bill and put a woman on the back. However, Jackson was a controversial figure in US history, particularly regarding his attitude towards Native Americans, and some groups are still calling for him to be replaced.

Harriet Tubman was an ideal candidate to replace Jackson. Born into slavery, she escaped and later worked as a spy and nurse for the Union army during the Civil War. She is remembered for leading hundreds of slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Tubman will be the first woman to be featured on American paper currency in over a century.

The US has rarely changed the face on its paper bills, making this a particularly historic event. The new design will be introduced in 2020, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.
