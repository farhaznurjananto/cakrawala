Spiders have a sweet tooth, or so to speak. Scientists have recently discovered that these arachnids, despite their reputation as pure carnivores, have a rather unique dietary habit. Some species of spiders, it seems, consume pollen grains as a regular component of their diet, making up nearly a quarter of their food intake.

Spider webs are meticulously engineered hunting tools that trap insects and other aerial prey. However, these masterfully crafted webs can also ensnare pollen grains and fungal spores. In order to investigate whether spiders were indeed taking advantage of these non-insect food sources, researchers conducted feeding experiments and stable isotope analysis on young spiders.

Based on the findings of the research, about 25% of the spiders' diet consisted of pollen grains, while the remaining 75% came from flying insects. Furthermore, the spiders that consumed both pollen and insects received the optimal nourishment, with all essential nutrients delivered by the combination.

"The proportion of pollen in the spiders' diet in the wild was high, so we need to classify them as omnivores rather than carnivores," Dirk Sanders, one of the researchers, said in a news release.

What's more surprising is that the spiders actively target pollen grains by coating them with digestive enzymes before ingestion, indicating their preference for the nutrients found in pollen. Orb web spiders were also found to eat their webs to recycle silk proteins, and in doing so, consume pollen grains.

"This study provides evidence that spiders are not purely carnivorous, but can take advantage of a range of food sources. It contributes to a growing body of research that is challenging our traditional perceptions of spider ecology and behavior," Sanders added.

The discovery of spiders consuming pollen challenges the common perception of spiders as deadly predators which feed solely on other living animals. The findings of this study make it clear that spiders are not only predators but adept omnivores that can take advantage of a variety of food sources. The study has been published in the journal PLOS One.
