London copywriter Chris Worth has always been inspired by the world of fiction. When he was tasked with writing a piece about Fallout: New Vegas, he saw an opportunity to bring that world to life. He set out to explore the Mojave Desert to discover the similarities, parallels, and differences between the game and the real world. This turned out to be a week-long trip that required $3000 and five days of driving through the dessert. However, it was a trip Worth would never forget.

As a copywriter, Worth had a vested interest in exploring the locations in Fallout: New Vegas to see just how close to reality the game really is. And although the game is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the real world, the Fallout series still features many locations and buildings that exist today. In New Vegas, that meant areas like the Las Vegas Strip and towns including Nipton and Goodsprings. Mr. Worth traveled to thirty-four of these locations to take photos and place them side by side with screenshots from the game to see just where the line between fact and fantasy was drawn. He posted the results, as well as notes from his trip, on falloutnewvegastour.com last month.

Despite playing "very few" games and New Vegas being his first role-playing experience since the 1980s, Mr. Worth was determined to document the locations. He was not a gamer by any means, but he was an avid traveler. Even though he found it challenging to navigate the game, he found the trip to be satisfying. However, Mr. Worth did point out some of the things about the game that hindered his ability to enjoy it as a new gamer. For instance, RP games often require knowledge beyond what is offered in the tutorial section of the game. Had he had a better understanding of the mechanics of the game from the start, he could have had an even better experience.

In addition to exploring the game locations, Worth enjoyed discovering the sometimes unexpected ways in which Fallout: New Vegas was based on the real world. "Fallout is not our future, but the future as people in the 1950s imagined it," Worth told news.com.au. "That's the 'Golden Age of Science Fiction,' when aliens and ray guns were all the rage and spaceships competed to have the biggest tail fins," he said. "The Fallout: New Vegas designers apply this conceit in incredible detail—even the ads for Sugar Bombs and Sunset Sarsaparilla have the innocence of 1950s advertising."

Some parts of the game, like the famous Vault-Tec vaults, in which human survivors of a nuclear war take shelter, may not exist in real life. However, some areas that appear in the game, like the Nellis Air Force Base, are off-limits to civilians. This prevented Mr. Worth from documenting these locations. While he may have missed some locations, Mr. Worth still had a lot of fun exploring locations in the game and in real life.

As for which locations were the most satisfying to visit, Worth said he enjoyed the surprises along the way. For example, Bonnie Springs — an abandoned town in the game — isn’t a real town, but a Wild West theme park! Similarly, in Primm, home of the Bison Steve Casino — in reality, the Buffalo Bill Hotel — the buildings in the game seemed to be inspired not by the town’s architecture but the mock building facades decorating the inside of the casino itself. Lastly, he enjoyed the places based on America's national parks.

Overall, despite not being a hardcore gamer, Worth's trip was a fun and fulfilling experience. He didn't just capture the aesthetics of the game; he documented hidden details, which made both the game and the real world come alive. He reminded us that video games are not always about the gameplay, but the experiences they can create.
