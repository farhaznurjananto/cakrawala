As the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton's foreign policy record will be under scrutiny leading up to the general elections on November 8th. Although Clinton has been labeled as having a hawkish and military-driven foreign policy, particularly with regards to the Middle East, her time as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 indicates that she will likely adopt a more centrist approach, similar to that seen under George H. Bush, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and certain aspects of Barack Obama's doctrine. 

Clinton's foreign policy experience includes withdrawal from Iraq, initiating talks with the Taliban, opening negotiations with Iran, brokering a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, leading NATO air intervention in Libya, and driving people-to-people initiatives throughout the Middle East. Her opposition to ground troops in Syria and Libya and her willingness to engage in talks with the Taliban and Iran, counter the argument that she is a hawkish and militaristic figure. 

However, political labels have come to define and frame policy debates, often distorting the truth. A prime example can be seen with Obama's label as an anti-war candidate in 2008, as his legacy will be tied to the extensive use of drone attacks, intervention in Libya, and prolonging the war in Afghanistan. Similarly, Clinton is mislabeled as a hawk, with her positions on Middle Eastern policy often misinterpreted.

If elected, Clinton's foreign policy approach is expected to be centrist and pragmatic. Her list of advisers, including key Iran negotiator Wendy Sherman, former Undersecretary at State Nicholas Burns, close aide Jake Sullivan, and former State Department official Tamara Wittes, suggests a focus on engagement and visible US diplomatic presence. Individuals hoping for a return to George W. Bush's neoconservative policies or a simple continuation of Obama's policies, will likely be disappointed. 

In summary, a Hillary Clinton presidency, if elected, would bring about a more robust, visible, and complex centrist approach toward US leadership in the Middle East, utilizing multiple tools such as diplomacy and military pressure without resorting to the risky military projects of the George W. Bush era.
