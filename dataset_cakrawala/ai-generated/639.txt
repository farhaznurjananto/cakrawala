Introducing Nyakim Gatwech, a South Sudanese-American model challenging conventional beauty standards and inspiring others to embrace their unique appearance. The 24-year-old fashion icon, now based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is unapologetically proud of her richly pigmented skin. Routinely gaining over 10,000 likes on her Instagram posts, Gatwech describes herself as representing "a nation of warriors."

Not only promoting diversity in the fashion world, Gatwech is also a prominent advocate for Black rights globally. Proudly accepting the title "Queen of Darkness," she asserts, "Black is bold, black is beautiful, black is goldâ€¦ Don't let American standards damage your African soul." She encourages everyone to love their skin, regardless of its color or shade.

Although Gatwech's distinctive beauty is now celebrated, that wasn't always the case. In 2016, an Uber driver shockingly suggested she bleach her skin to which she responded by laughing. Since then, her confidence in her striking appearance has only grown. "My chocolate is elegant," she writes on Instagram.

With her newfound voice promoting self-esteem and empowerment for the Black community, Gatwech's infectious positivity has garnered over 100,000 followers on Instagram. Despite the occasional negative comment, she continues to radiate self-love, joyfully embracing her title as the "Queen of the Dark." Gatwech confidently proclaims, "My skin absorbs the sun's rays, and my hair defies gravity. Now you can't tell me I'm not magical!"
