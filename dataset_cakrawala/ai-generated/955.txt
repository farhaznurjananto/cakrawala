Americans have grown so accustomed to police misconduct and contentious shootings dominating the news that it's easy to forget that in some other countries, cops rarely shoot people. This distinction is especially noticeable in the United Kingdom, which shares a language and a love of the same premium cable shows as the United States. Though there are certainly controversies surrounding policing in the United Kingdom, the country's cops do not typically carry guns, which naturally reduces the number of shootings and deaths. To bridge this transatlantic divide, VICE UK's Joe Bish recently called up our US-based crime editor, Matt Taylor, and asked him to explain why law enforcement in America has become so controversial over the past few years. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York provided the image via. VICE: First and foremost: Could you please explain the distinctions between state police, sheriffs, federal police, and so on? Taylor, Matt: State police and local cops or sheriffs aren't that different in terms of your interaction with them or how they appear to most Americans on the street. They are all armed and dressed in what appears to be traditional police uniforms. Federal law enforcement is not as visible. At that level, there are several law enforcement agencies. There are marshals and the FBI, but no "federal cops" per se. Right. Then again, who doesn't? Is this true for everyone, from chiefs to detectives to beat cops? Almost every cop in America appears to be armed. The gun and holster seen on beat cops may not be present or visible in the case of chiefs or higher-level officers such as detectives. For example, New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton That job is actually a step up from "chief," but it doesn't have one, at least not that we can see. His is a more political role. What's the wage gap between, say, a commissioner and a lowly street-based police officer? Is there any internal concern within the police force about the disparity? It's substantial, but probably not as massive as you might think. Certainly not on the same scale as, say, the wage disparity between low-level workers and CEOs in the majority of American businesses and corporations. Even regular beat cops can do well in some areas. I grew up on eastern Long Island, in East Hampton, which is essentially a resort town, and getting a job as a cop out there is said to be a life sentence. Because of a healthy local tax base, lots of valuable real estate, and so on, one can easily earn well above the median salary in the US. Police unions are a powerful force in American politics, or at least they were. Their clout is dwindling, as is that of most organized labor organizations in the United States. Returning to New York, it is not uncommon to witness the police union and other related groups sparring with the mayor over issues ranging from money to civilian deaths. The "us and them" divide between police and the general public does not appear to be as severe in the UK as it is in the US, depending on where you go. There are obviously controversies, but they are generally kept quiet, whereas American cops seem to scream and shout about how wronged they are. Do you believe this is part of a broader sense of patriotism in American society? As in, people who protect the great nation deserve more respect? Yes, it most likely is. As I believe you are implying, we Americans have a penchant for guns and the strong men who wield them. That type of John Wayne mentality stems from adoration for the armed forces, even when they commit atrocities against civilians, each other, and cops. The mantra is that white Americans love and respect cops and feel safe in their presence. Whereas blacks, Latinos, and other minorities have been socialized to be wary. Cops, I believe, have become "others" in a new way in the last year or so. Whereas in the 1990s and 2000s many police shootingsand there were manyof people of color stoked controversy, something about the killings that began last summerwith Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Fergusonhas touched a chord. Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 was probably the spark that started this uproar, even though [his killer, George Zimmerman] wasn't an actual cop, just a rogue neighborhood watchman. Yes, I was going to say: this cop mentality appears to extend to anyone with even a semblance of authority. Everyone has mace, a gun, or a Taser, including mall cops and security guards. Where does the weaponization of the common man come from, and why is it so widespread?
