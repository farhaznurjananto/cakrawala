Saheela Ibraheem, a bright and talented fifteen-year-old from Piscataway, New Jersey, wasn't sure any college would want to admit a student so young. So, she hedged her bets and filled out applications to 14 schools, ranging from New Jersey to California. Despite her concerns, her exceptional academic record, and her stellar extracurricular activities, including being a three-sport athlete and serving in various leadership roles in her community, earned her acceptance to thirteen colleges, including six of the eight Ivy League Schools.

The young student had to make a tough decision about which college to attend after winning such considerable attention from several reputed institutions. After weeks of contemplation, Saheela settled with Harvard, where she will be one of the youngest members of the college's freshman class. "I’ll be one of the youngest, but I won’t be the youngest," the soon-to-be sixteen-year-old said.

Saheela is among the millions of high school seniors throughout the US who had to finalize their college decisions by the Monday deadline for incoming freshman to send deposits to the school of their choice. Nationwide, this year's college selection process was one of the most competitive in history, as institutions received a record number of applications from students worldwide.

Saheela joins a growing number of New Jersey students who've enrolled in college before they are old enough to earn a driver's license. Last year, Kyle Loh of Mendham University graduated from Rutgers at 16, and in previous years, two 15-year-old cousins, along with a 14-year-old from Cranbury, earned their degrees from Rutgers.

Saheela's exceptional academic trajectory began during her middle school days when as a sixth-grader at the Conackamack Middle School in Piscataway, she asked to move to a higher-level class to learn more about her favorite subject, math. To her credit, the school let her skip sixth grade altogether.

As a high school student, Saheela felt her public school classes were no longer challenging her. Therefore, she moved to the Wardlaw-Hartridge School, a private school with a student population of 420, where she skipped her freshman year and enrolled directly as a 10th-grader. Her three younger brothers have also eventually joined her at the institution.

School officials were impressed with Saheela, given that she didn't just focus on book reading and academic excellence. She has been described as a student who keeps pushing herself to be better consistently. William Jenkins, the Wardlaw-Hartridge School's director of development, described Saheela as someone who's learned and very smart.

Saheela also excels outside the classroom. She is a three-sport athlete, playing outfield for the school’s softball team, defender on the soccer team, and swimming relays and 50-meter races for the swim team. She also sings alto in the school choir, plays trombone in the school band, and serves as the president of the school’s investment club, which teaches students about the stock market by investing in virtual stocks.

Saheela began applying to colleges last fall. Her applications included her 96 to 97 Grade Point Average (GPA) on a 100-point scale and her 2,340 SAT score. Her SAT score was excellent, with a perfect 800 in mathematics, a 790 in writing, and a 750 in reading.

Saheela got her first acceptance from the California Institute of Technology in December, following which more acceptance offers flooded in. She also received acceptance letters from some of the world's most prestigious schools, including Harvard, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Williams College, Stanford, the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, MIT, and Washington University in St. Louis.

The student then received a rejection letter on March 30 from Yale. Saheela isn't sure why the Ivy League school didn't want her, and her parents thought it might have had to do with her age.

Saheela was initially torn between attending MIT or Harvard. However, a visit to both campuses last month helped her make the choice easier. Her mother, Shakirat Ibraheem, confirmed that she went to Harvard and fell in love with the place.

Saheela said she wants to major in either neurobiology or neuroscience and plans to become a research scientist who studies how the brain works. As for her own brain, Saheela insists she is nothing special; she credits her parents with teaching her to love learning and work hard. Her father, Sarafa, an analyst and vice president at a financial firm in New York, would often study with her at night and homeschool her in subjects not taught in school. Saheela's latest decision to attend Harvard University illustrates the possibilities that await students who challenge themselves positively and dream big.
