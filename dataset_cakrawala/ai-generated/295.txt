Mixson's new taqueria Bàsico, located in North Charleston is a restaurant that is worth checking out this summer. With grilled butterbeans, charred shishito peppers, and Sopa being some of the treats to indulge in, the Mixson Bath and Racquet Club will be bringing a taste of Mexico to its poolside. Proprietor Bryan Lewis, formerly of Heirloom Book Co., has brought in two talented chefs, Leila Schardt and Italo Marino. Both graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, and Moreno cooked at Daniel and Ai Fiori while Schardt worked for Michael White at Alto and Marea. 

Bàsico will serve a small, ever-changing menu that will allow the chefs to utilize whole animals and build closer relationships with farmers. They have also planted some of their vegetables that will be parked right outside the restaurant. The menu will be completely homemade, from the salsas and tortillas to the ice cream. The tortas consist of lamb bacon, heirloom tomato, and grilled summer squash, while the tacos include cabeza, grilled shrimp, and chorizo. During dinner hours, the menu expands to include platos grandes, featuring dishes such as Michelada Seafood Boil, Pescado, and bone marrow with cilantro gremolata, grilled bread, and micro salad. Tacos are priced at $3 per, and tortas at $9. Platos range from $12-$15.

Adding to their charm, two pastry chefs from Chicago, along with beverage director Kevin Hilton, have joined the team. In honor of Lewis' intense wine background, the restaurant features a Cava Tasting Menu to enjoy while lounging at the pool.

Lastly, the restaurant accommodates the public for lunch, dinner, and Sunday brunch. The prospect of enjoying fresh, clean Mexican-inspired food at a new restaurant is what makes the menu at Bàsico unique and worth trying.
