As the US Presidential election approaches, concerns regarding the potential costs of the outcome are being raised. If Clinton wins, the largest cost could arise from the need for individuals like Donald Trump’s supporters to be appeased as they contend that the election has been stolen from their candidate. The narrower Clinton’s victory margin, the easier it will be for Mr Trump to claim that the election was rigged. This narrow win would give him more power over Republicans in Congress as legislators are more likely to respond to feedback from their electorates. The House is known to be the place where the link between elected representatives and their electorates is strongest. If Mr Trump can ignite his supporters’ emotions, Republican legislators will take their cue from them. 

Most of the Republican voters already believe that Mrs Clinton is corrupt and dishonest. Hence, endorsing Mr Trump’s claims that the Clintons are a “criminal enterprise” wouldn’t be a significant leap. Removing oneself from such amped-up language and temperament is hard, and the situation is compounded by the fact that the target is Mrs Clinton. Prior to re-entering the White House, she has been the most investigated political figure in US history. Many investigations and subpoenas have already been launched against her; and if she wins next week, Mrs Clinton will face many more. Republicans have reportedly been looking to WikiLeaks for fresh material to use against her. 

Mrs Clinton’s failure to promise to sever family links with the Clinton Foundation adds to her woes. It is unsettling that she has not yet addressed this issue. Currently, the plan is for Chelsea Clinton to take over its day-to-day running. However, for Mrs Clinton’s image to remain unblemished, it is essential that she clearly distances herself from the foundation. The foundation has taken billions of dollars from governments, companies and wealthy individuals, some of which are highly suspect in origin. For example, governments such as Qatar and Morocco channelled money through Mr Clinton, rather than the UN or the Gates Foundation. To her opponents, the Clinton Foundation looks like a sea of scandal. The foundation’s activities have provided endless fodder for news stories and fuelled many controversies. 

Mrs Clinton’s public perception is also not helping her image. She is the first President since Gallup started polling to have a low trust among the American public. This is a problem that she created for herself. Every time she takes any decision that has a bearing on a former donor to the Clinton Foundation, there is a perception of conflict of interest. This enhances when entities that have also paid private speaking fees to either Clinton are involved. If Mrs Clinton doesn't wind down the foundation, holding potential conflicts of interest will be a major challenge for her. 

It is essential for Mrs Clinton to promise to mothball the Clinton Foundation. The longer she delays, the more challenging it will become. It is not only her husband's pride and her daughter's future that is at risk; her ability to govern America is also at stake. A Clinton-appointed regulator dismissing charges against Goldman Sachs would be viewed with scepticism by the Democratic left, whereas a significant arms sale to a Gulf state may not be taken at face value. This is why it is important for her to unequivocally distance herself from potential conflicts of interest.
