 very realistic facsimile 
 
 TLDR version. like. i really like it 
 
 I've been looking for a thrust toy for a long time, and as anyone who's ever used a thrust dildo can tell you, I've pretty much given up on everything I could get my hands on because they tend to contract when excited. It's not about blocking the thrust. Most of the toys move, but  a few motors have broken in the past. Also for disclosure: I'm not a fan of vibrators. I took a chance by purchasing this toy because vibrators paralyze me. So I had  high expectations for this toy. Its price  also helped  my high expectations. 
 
 The packaging of the toy is very simple. The image of the toy in the box is very gender neutral. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the box. I thought there would be some extra weight from the pulsating movement, but I didn't expect that much weight. It was also much more than I expected. My inner  queen was pleasantly surprised. 
  Inside the box was a toy with an instruction manual and the toy itself. So the charger wasn't a source of weight. I was a little hesitant when I saw that the charger was magnetic. I've had very bad experiences  in the past where the magnetic charger didn't get a good connection and I had to do  crazy twists to keep the charger in place. But I wanted to stay open. 
 I plugged  the charger into my computer and tried what I thought would be a crazy twist. no wizard
