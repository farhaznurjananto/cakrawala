In the midst of the impending doom of a Trump presidency and a Cubs World Series, British satirist Andy Zaltzman is bringing his wit and political commentary to America. Zaltzman is best known for co-hosting the popular podcast The Bugle with John Oliver, wherein the duo discuss and riff on world news and politics, primarily with an American focus. Zaltzman's expertise are vast and include politics, punning, and cricket. 

Zaltzman recently announced a relaunch of The Bugle for October 21st, after being on hiatus. With his first tour of the United States, starting with a visit to Chicago's House of Blues on October 4th, excitement among his American fans is high.

During an interview, Zaltzman and Oliver's deep knowledge of American history and politics was discussed. When asked where the knowledge comes from, Zaltzman explained that while Oliver had already been living in the United States while hosting The Daily Show when The Bugle first started in 2007, their ability to keep up with American political and social issues stems from America's influence as a global player in geopolitics.

Regarding the recent presidential debates, Zaltzman expressed his disappointment in the lacklustre nature of US politics. He expressed his shock at the fact that Trump has made it so far in the race, and that even those outside of the US are watching with horror and confusion.

While Zaltzman believes Clinton should not attempt to be funnier than she currently is, he believes that everyone needs to take a step back and really try to understand the Trump phenomenon. He suggests that more time should be spent examining what Trump represents, why so many people are supporting him, and whether there is more to him than what is currently being discussed.

When it comes to Chicago, Zaltzman already has topics to cover - emails from fans have ranged from cricket to Illinois governors to Chicago-style hot dog toppings. While Zaltzman is known for his puns, he admits that not everyone is a fan, but he will still try to incorporate them into his show.

As he prepares for his Chicago gig at the House of Blues, Zaltzman admits to being a huge fan of blues music, and he hopes to incorporate this into his show. He is also looking forward to the Chicago Cubs' success, as he is a fan of cricket and is familiar with the Cubs' history of losing. He jokes that if the Cubs win the World Series, it would be terrible for humanities tourism.
