  Rated 5 out of 5 out of 8Bit  I have her 3 ferrets and he has 2 corner  boxes in their cages. Eventually they started pooping next to it instead of pooping. I stressed that I was investigating. I found my toilet too small. So I bought this  and everything changed! No more accidents outside  the box! I  have a ferret who loves to "move around" in his cage. So I bought Velcro and on 02/04/2016 another problem was solved  
 
 Rated 5 out of 5 by luvmypetkids. This is the  best of all Recycle Bins. Large enough for a ferret to fully enter and return to a high wall. The size, shape, and weight of the pot, including the litter (I use Marshall paper pellets) discourage the ferret from tipping or moving it. There is also a hiding place for toys in the back! Great quality, construction and easy care. And the best prices are on F&S!!! Oct 12, 2015 
 
 Rated 5 out of 5 stars by ChristyCal. My ferret had an accident with a corner pan. I was very frustrated with this. The delivery was quick and the packaging was solid. I  received a magazine catalog with my order. I really like this and  will order again from now on
