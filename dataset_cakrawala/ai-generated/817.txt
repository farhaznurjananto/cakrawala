 A green truck with lots of inventory slots. Like  Mod:Ural Civilian,  V3S can knock down small trees without damaging them. It is slightly smaller than the Ural, has less fuel capacity, but has better maneuverability. Due to its color and size, it is easier to hide than the Urals. 
 
 Unlike the Ural Civilian, the V3S doesn't have a tarp around the passenger seat, making it much easier to spot and shoot passengers.
