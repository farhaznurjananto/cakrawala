DimStar, the responsible party The openSUSE Tumbleweed project has automated acceptance testing. For Tumbleweed to be automatically released, all of the tests in this work group, with the exception of the ignored issues, must pass. totest-manager, a bot, manages the procedure. It is recommended to execute totest-manager.py —dry —debug. Try out Factory on your own machine to see a sample of what its evaluation could entail. It is possible that the repository is already published at this time; to verify this, you can use the command osc meta —blame prj openSUSE:Factory:ToTest | grep -A1 'publish>'. The following two lines in your /.oscrc file may be helpful: [openSUSE:Factory] staging=openSUSE:Factory:Staging The comments containing the ignored issues are collected and kept in OSRT:IgnoredIssues. Due to the webui's inability to preserve newlines during editing, osc is your only option. Go there to get real-time results for package differences. You can see how far along the building/testing/publishing process the latest snapshot is by using the openSUSE:Factory dashboard. Please drop by for conversations and to lend a hand.
