Throughout his tenure with the Minnesota Vikings, Rick Spielman has never shied away from making bold moves. With memorable player trades like Jared Allen and Percy Harvin, free agent signings such as Brett Favre, and draft-day excitement involving Matt Kalil and Cordarrelle Patterson, Spielman keeps fans on their toes. Even during less eventful off-seasons, he produces at least one surprise worth talking about. 

With today's roster cuts, as outlined by Arif, the Vikings reportedly stand to gain an impressive $41 million in cap space. Moreover, Spielman is armed with a full complement of draft picks. While most fans may have certain expectations of Spielman's strategy regarding free agency and the draft, the potential exists for surprises. Whether relying on intuition, interpreting patterns from Spielman's past decisions or sheer speculation, there is anticipation of a significant move.

One possibility is acquiring a much-needed top-tier quarterback. Following a disappointing 2012 season, rumors suggested that the San Diego Chargers might be willing to trade quarterback Philip Rivers, whose contract is set to expire in two seasons. With a $13.8 million salary and the Chargers lacking cap space, the time could be right for Spielman to take advantage of the situation. 

Another option to consider is solidifying the team's defense with an investment in a high-quality cornerback. At 28 years old, Darrelle Revis has been at the center of trade rumors involving the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who may be looking to offload his $13 million base salary. The addition of head coach Mike Zimmer further complicates the Vikings' defensive plans.

Lastly, there is potential for Spielman to target offensive playmakers such as Lance Moore, Darren Sproles, or even tight end/wide receiver Jimmy Graham, currently the subject of a non-exclusive franchise tag with the New Orleans Saints. Depending on how Graham's position is negotiated, he could prove to be a valuable asset. 

Of course, these three scenarios are simply ideas to consider. Fans are encouraged to share their thoughts in the comments section about what type of off-season moves they believe Rick Spielman might execute. One thing is certain: Speculating on Spielman's plans is never a dull affair.
