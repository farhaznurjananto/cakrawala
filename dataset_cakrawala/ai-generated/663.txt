Mark Hughes is anticipated to finalize the signing of Juan Agudelo over the weekend and has also joined the race to offer Scott Sinclair a fresh start away from Manchester City. Sinclair had only moved from Swansea City last summer.

New England Revolution striker Agudelo is in advanced negotiations for a transfer away from the MLS club, and Stoke City is the latest club to show interest in Manchester City's Sinclair, who has been told he can leave the City of Manchester Stadium.

Agudelo, who has 17 caps for the United States, held discussions with manager Hughes during Stoke's recent American tour after invoking an MLS rule allowing him to speak to clubs interested in signing him after July 1.

The 20-year-old has caught the attention of other Premier League clubs, including Crystal Palace, but the presence of USA internationals Geoff Cameron and Brek Shea at Britannia Stadium is believed to have tipped the balance in Stoke's favor.

Agudelo had extensive conversations with Hughes in Philadelphia this week, and chief executive Tony Scholes stayed behind after the Stoke touring party returned home to continue pursuing Agudelo's signature.

Hughes aims to adopt a more attacking style this season and seeks to strengthen his forward options after failing to secure Portuguese striker Nelson Oliveira from Benfica.

The move for Sinclair further demonstrates the Welshman's desire for a more expansive approach, and Hughes is prepared to compete with Everton, Newcastle United, and West Bromwich Albion for the former Swansea winger.

WBA has held lengthy negotiations with City over Sinclair, aiming to secure a 12-month loan move. However, City manager Manuel Pellegrini does not see the winger in his long-term plans and will allow him to leave for around Â£6 million.

Over the past two weeks, Hughes has been evaluating the squad he inherited from Tony Pulis and is expected to meet with the club's board next week to discuss potential new signings.
