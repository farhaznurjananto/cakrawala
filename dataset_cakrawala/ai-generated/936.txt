Intel looks intent on entering the content distribution market: The Wall Street Journal reports that the chip manufacturer plans to introduce a web-based TV service under the Intel name, replete with a set-top box manufactured by Intel. Intel has reportedly been pitching media businesses for months, with ambitions to offer similar TV channel options to existing cable and satellite TV providers, with the exception that all material would be delivered via the internet. Clients must supply their own internet connection in order to access this service. Intel hopes to provide this service by the end of the year, however it is not yet known if the corporation will be able to do so. According to a source cited by the Wall Street Journal, no content agreements have been reached yet. With this potential new service, the ever-present rumors of an Apple TV set, and the proposed online TV network Ora.tv attempting to coax Larry King out of retirement, it appears like internet-based TV could begin to exert significant pressure on cable companies.
