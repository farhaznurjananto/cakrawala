Million Dollar Extreme (MDE) is an American sketch comedy group consisting of Sam Hyde, Nick Rochefort, and Charls Carroll. The group has been noted for their use of irony, dark humor, and offensive comedy.

MDE has been involved in a number of controversies, most notably their involvement in the alt-right movement and their use of racist and anti-Semitic humor. In 2016, Hyde was accused of being a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi, which he denied. MDE has also been accused of being misogynistic and homophobic.

MDE was formed in 2005 in Austin, Texas. Hyde, Rochefort, and Carroll had all worked together at the College of William and Mary's sketch comedy group, The Hatriots. Hyde and Rochefort had also been friends for years, and Carroll had been Hyde's roommate at William and Mary.

The group's early material was characterized by dark humor and irony, with a focus on taboo topics. In 2006, Hyde and Rochefort created the character of Dr. Steve Brule, a mentally ill, obese, and socially awkward individual who is the group's primary comedian. Brule became a popular character on the group's website and YouTube channel, and has since appeared in a number of MDE shorts and television appearances.

In 2007, MDE released their first full-length comedy movie, "Super Troopers". The film was well-received by critics, and was nominated for three awards at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

In 2010, MDE collaborated with the music group The Lonely Island on the song "Dick in a Box", which was featured in the film "The Green Hornet".

In 2013, MDE released their second full-length comedy movie, " NTSF:SD:SUV::". The film was nominated for two awards at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, and was well-received by critics.

In 2016, Hyde was accused of being a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi, which he denied. Hyde's comments about race and ethnicity came to light after he was photographed at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Hyde later issued an apology for his remarks, stating that he "did not mean to endorse these views".

In 2017, MDE released their third full-length comedy movie, "The Movie". The film was well-received by critics, and was nominated for two awards at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.
