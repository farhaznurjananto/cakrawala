Check out our Twitter feed at and Chad Qualls, a right-handed reliever who was a key part of the bullpen during the glory days, has been signed by the Astros. The deal is for two years and is worth $6 million, plus possible bonuses and a $3.5 million club option for 2016. The 35-year-old former Astros pitcher who is now a "journeyman" and has thrown for eight different teams will go back to his old team and probably take on a setup role. Quallsy just had a great year with the Marlins when he was 34. He had a WAR of 1.8 and will be the best arm out of the bullpen right away. The big right-handed pitcher has only two pitches: a sinker and a slider. These two pitches have mostly helped him over the years. Last year, Chad's sinker had the highest average speed of his career, at 93.9 MPH, so it looks like he has found a second wind and isn't going backwards. When Chad left Houston for Arizona with Chris Burke in the Jose Valverde trade, he closed in 2009 and 2010, but he probably won't do it again when he goes back home. Qualls is likely to take on a lot of work, but he shouldn't have any trouble doing so because he has never worked less than 50 innings in a season except for his first. This move fills the team's biggest hole by far, and it won't be the last one made to improve the bullpen. Jeff Luhnow and his team have made a lot of progress in the last week, and the big league team has grown by leaps and bounds. It's nice to have a player from the 2004-2005 teams back in Houston, and I hope Qualls can win another game for the Astros. Here are some of Qualls' stats from baseball-reference.com and a video of the famous fist pump.
