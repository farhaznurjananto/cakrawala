Tennessee Wide Receiver DeAnthony Arnett Seeks Release to Transfer Closer to Ill Father

On Thursday, DeAnthony Arnett, the Tennessee wide receiver expressed his desire to be released from the university in order to transfer closer to his ill father who resides in Saginaw, Michigan. As a true freshman this season, Arnett had impressive stats with 24 catches for 242 yards and two touchdowns. He was also recognized as one of the highest-rated prospects in coach Derek Dooley's 2011 recruiting class and was ranked in the ESPNU150. 

Arnett clarified his request citing the need to support his father who has suffered two heart attacks, dialysis, and has undergone a series of surgeries. In his plea, he also stated his intention to transfer to all schools in Michigan. Although the school has agreed to release him to Mid-American Conference (MAC) schools located in Michigan, he will have to pay his own way to attend a Big Ten school.

Arnett has been grateful for the opportunities he received at the University of Tennessee and wanted to clarify that his need for transfer is not a reflection of the university. He was hopeful to be granted an unconditional release to any school in Michigan.

Tennessee spokesperson confirmed that Arnett is not being denied the opportunity to transfer and play FBS-level football; however, the university has a strict policy of not releasing players to schools Tennessee plays or recruits against.

The Vols have a talented roster of players, including a rising standout quarterback, Tyler Bray, and wide receivers Justin Hunter and Da'Rick Rogers returning next season. Despite Arnett's request to transfer, the team is anticipated to have a successful year. 

Joe Schad, a college football reporter for ESPN, reported on Arnett's request and highlighted the wide receiver's impressive performance during his freshman year.
