Anfield is known to have some of the most loyal fans in the world, but lately there has been increasing talk about fans leaving early during game time. This issue has been met with criticism by fans who claim that those who leave early are not "real fans", but are those fans quick to judge? 

One fan, Les Jackson, has been going to Anfield since 1968, and he shared his thoughts on this matter on an online forum. Jackson admits that he is usually situated in the lower centenary region of the stadium, but denied being a "miserable sod" who constantly moans. In fact, Jackson just has a mind of his own.

The Liverpool fan highlights that he tends to employ a "live and let live" attitude when it comes to fans leaving early. Although Jackson doesn't agree with the way some people leave en masse after their team concedes a late goal, he appreciates that at times, it is necessary for people to leave early due to other engagements, work or transport issues.

Jackson questioned why there is so much dialogue surrounding fans leaving early at Anfield. He makes it clear that supporters across the globe leave matches early for various reasons, and Anfield's situation is no different. He adds that these supporters are not extremists or uncommitted. It’s just that sometimes it’s necessary to leave early to attend to other important things in life.

The fan also touched upon the issue of Liverpool fans’ superiority complex. For years, Liverpool fans have referred to themselves as “the best supporters in the world,” but Jackson believes that this is not entirely true. Using examples, such as when sections of The Kop devised to get under the skin of then Liverpool manager Bob Paisley, or when a significant number of fans unjustly targeted midfielder John Barnes with disgraceful abuse during a 1987 Watford game, Jackson illustrates that Liverpool fans have not always been the "best supporters in the world." 

The Liverpool fan then concluded by saying that being the "best supporter in the world" doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the amount of money or time one invests in their team. It doesn't require a great deal of self-sacrifice to follow Liverpool as 'the best team in world' since they are typically contender every year. Moreover, sometimes it's not about how many games you attend or how loud you cheer, 'it's just about enjoying the little things in the experience, as well as the bigger things in life. Therefore, if a fan chooses to leave early to prioritize other things, let them, live and let live.
