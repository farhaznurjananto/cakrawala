Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) spokesman Naeemul Haque sparked controversy when he recently referred to Afghan Taliban chief, Mullah Mansour, as a 'martyr'. The PTI spokesman told Dawn.com that he believed 'shaheed' (martyr) is a "political term" and that fighting against foreign invaders is a just cause. Haque cited examples of Indian Muslims killed by Pakistani forces in Kargil, who were also referred to as 'shaheed'. Mansour, who took control of the group after a fierce power struggle following the death of its founder Mullah Omar, was killed in a US drone strike in Baluchistan in May; subsequently, the Taliban has split.
 
Some have criticised Haque for what was viewed as his sympathies and support for the Taliban. It is worth noting that in 2013, PTI chief Imran Khan called for the immediate blockade of Nato supplies following the killing of the then-Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) chief in a US drone strike in North Waziristan. Religious parties such as Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) also referred to the TTP chief as a 'martyr' following his death. The Afghan Taliban has been responsible for multiple acts of terrorism inside Afghanistan and Pakistan, including attacks on Pakistani military targets.
 
The drone strike prompted anger in Pakistan, with the government calling it a violation of its sovereignty. However, following the incident, there were signs that Pakistani intelligence services were pitching to influence the Taliban in favour of peace talks.
 
Following the statement, the backlash over social media polarised people's opinion. Many criticised him for his sympathies whilst others suggested that it was a slip of tongue.
