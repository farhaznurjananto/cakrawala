How Award-Winning Spago Makes Its Spectacular Salads

Recently, a cook anonymously posted pictures of junk food plated like gourmet cuisine that went viral on Instagram! The humorous dishes appealed to many, as they poked fun at clichéd restaurant cooking techniques, such as the bowl being used for the dish, ingredients roped along the rim, and haphazard sauce splatters. While these approaches may be widely copied, they are no match for the artistic vision of celebrated chefs.

We reached out to chefs nationwide to identify their most beautiful dish creations. After they gave us their choices, we supplied photographers with a clear, straightforward directive – make these stunning plates look as stunning as possible!

While we would love to include every fantastic restaurant we know, we had to refrain due to the sheer volume of talented chefs, but the resulting 100+ photographs exhibit technical expertise and imaginative innovation. Our goal was to showcase splendour, precision, and unforgettable dishes that remind you of what happens when highly creative, intelligent people devote every day of their lives to advancing their craft. We believe we have done a good job of it, but you can always take a look at the list for yourself! 

Now, let's talk about Spago's incredible salads. Their goal is to design a dish that not only tastes divine, but looks like a work of art. Featuring the freshness of mixed greens, veggies harvested from local farms, house-made dressings, premium-quality cheese, nuts, and grilled meats or seafood, these salads are not just pleasing to the palate but provide a visual feast, as well. 

The presentation of each component is thoughtful and precise, and the plates themselves are works of art. One salad, for example, features spring peas, English pea puree, and mint yogurt – a vibrant green combination that is visually stunning. 

Spago has been awarded two Michelin stars and has remained one of the best restaurants in America for over two decades. They believe that food should not only taste great, but it should be aesthetically pleasing, as well. After all, we do say that we eat with our eyes first.
