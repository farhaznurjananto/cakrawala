Warner Brothers is set to release one of its most significant films to date, but initial reactions to Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice have been mixed. The film, which follows Man of Steel and marks the start of the DC Cinematic Universe, has polarized early reactions, raising concerns that it may not live up to its expectations as a worldwide phenomenon.

More than a year ago, both this film and Captain America: Civil War slated to be released on the same day, May 6th, 2016. While Dawn of Justice took the spot first, it is hard to think DC wasn’t aware that Marvel has released a film every first weekend of May since 2007, almost all of which have seen substantial results. WB then made the strategic move of changing Dawn of Justice's release date to the last weekend of March, which was not a bad idea. However, the film's hype could have allowed for a successful release at any time of the year.

Dawn of Justice may have a better chance at success, especially against Captain America: Civil War, since it has virtually zero competition coming up. The only blockbuster film released recently was Deadpool, which at this point, is done with its theatrical run, leaving The Jungle Book, which is slated for release on April 15th. Batman V Superman has three full weekends to make a lot of money, allowing the film to do plenty of business given how front loaded it is shaping up to be.

However, the film faces some challenges. It currently has a terrible 32% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a massive leak of spoilers from early showings is coupled with very mixed responses from pre-screening audiences, which could hurt its opening weekend results. The truly worrying aspect is the film's long-term potential, given its critical response, which is unheard of for a film of this size.

Man of Steel had a strange opening pattern back in 2013, but with special tickets sold at Walmart, the film managed to make over $130M by Sunday. This is a number that Batman V Superman needs to beat when adjusted for inflation. The film may face tough competition next week with God’s Not Dead 2 and allegedly Collide. The former is a known name, while the latter has yet to receive any publicity, so we might expect a placeholder soon.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, a sequel to the 2002 blockbuster that made $360M with inflation, may not perform as well. Despite the success of the original, the older audience is probably not that interested in this film. Midnight Special is getting a small expansion after a strong start in five theatres on limited release last weekend, while I Saw the Light is not expected to do well.

Batman V Superman must surpass records set by The Hunger Games with $152.5M to avoid bad press. This weekend's box office predictions include Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice with $140M, Zootopia with $24.5M, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 with $11.5M, The Divergent Series: Allegiant with $10.0M, and Miracles from Heaven with $9.5M.
