Girl's Day, the popular girl group, is embarking on a new journey. According to their entertainment agency, Dream Tea, the group will be travelling to Thailand on August 17 to work as honorary ambassadors for Plan Korea. The international child support organization is dedicated to raising awareness about girls' human rights and supporting the advancement of young girls worldwide.

This is not the first time that Girl's Day has participated in Plan Korea's volunteer program. They volunteered in Thailand last August and were actively involved in helping young girls who were married off at a young age and were victims of domestic violence. The group was commended for their hard work and dedication towards their cause.

Plan Korea is delighted to have Girl's Day participate in their volunteer program once again. This time, the pop singers will be meeting four little girls who do not have birth certificates. The lack of certificates poses significant challenges for these young girls, as it makes it difficult for them to access basic education and healthcare facilities.

Girl's Day will work alongside Plan Korea to help the four little girls acquire birth certificates so that they can access essential services. The group's efforts will enable these girls to experience a life of dignity and respect.

In conclusion, Girl's Day is committed to making a difference in the lives of young girls who struggle with hardships. Their involvement with Plan Korea is a testament to their belief in and dedication towards promoting girls' human rights. Their work with Plan Korea is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the positive impact that celebrities can have by using their platform for worthy causes.
