The Senegalese midfielder moved to St. James' Park in 2016 with hopes of making a name for himself in the Premier League. But United quickly got into a relegation fight, and Saivet lost his spot on Steve McClaren's team after just four games. Rafa Benitez decided not to bring him back. When Newcastle fell out of the Premier League and into the Championship, Saivet was sent on loan to St. Etienne. He made 38 appearances for the Ligue 1 club, but Christophe Galtier said he had lost his desire to play. Galtier was very honest when he said, "If he didn't play in England, I now know why: he is no longer hungry. At all."

Saivet told the Chronicle in his first big interview since returning to the club, "I want to play for Newcastle United." Putting on a Newcastle shirt is a great honor. It's a big club, and when you put on the jersey and go out on the field, even if you're in the reserves, you have to give it your all. Every time you play, you want to do well." Saivet only played for the club briefly during preseason, but he was back on the field at St. James' Park on Monday night in front of just 721 people. He enjoyed every second of a solid 90-minute run out that showed fans how good he is in midfield. He said: "It's always good to play, get runs, and make an overall contribution. I'm feeling better and better, so it was great that I went out." Rafa Benitez has never had a problem with Saivet's attitude or skills, unlike some other players at the club. He just likes other members of the team more than Saivet.

He said: "I need to prove to him that I can play on his team. Every time I train or play a reserve game, I have to do my best." He told me to show what I can do, and he said that we need everyone on the team, so I'll keep going. "Maybe I'll get a chance to show what I can do one day. I'm sure there will be an opportunity." You can start a football season in the stands or on the bench, but you have to finish it on the team "You never know, but I'm always ready to play. I need to stay in shape. I'll play for the back-up team." Since the season is long and it's important to get better as it goes on, I'll do that." When Saivet came back to play for Newcastle last summer, some Toon fans praised the former Bordeaux star. After making some good appearances, Saivet got some messages of support from his fans. He said: "It always makes you feel sure of yourself. In football, that is the most important thing. If you're sure of yourself, you can do anything on the field. You have to keep going and work." You should never complain about not playing, because the team is what matters most. We just got back, so we have to win to stay in the Premier League." It won't be easy, so people won't be able to complain about their own lives. It is always easier if you are healthy and able to play. You rush around and try to get everything done." A footballer doesn't like it when they can't play. To get back into the game, you have to work hard "If I get a chance, I'll have to stay where I am. I will always do my best." Newcastle is hoping to move up the table by winning this weekend's game against Liverpool. Saivet, who scored against the Reds in the Europa League when he was playing for Bordeaux, said, "The spirit is very, very good." We have to work hard, and no one should be upset about it. Everyone is doing the best they can. The most important thing for us is that the team will keep getting better." Saivet made it clear that he was happy in Tyneside and at the club. He said: "It's a very big club.
