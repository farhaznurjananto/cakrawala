The Electronic Sports League (ESL) has announced a new policy to begin testing its competitors for the use of performance enhancing drugs at all ESL competitions, beginning with ESL One Cologne in August. The ESL has teamed up with both the German National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to establish a comprehensive policy that is both fair and effective.

Today's announcement follows a controversy involving professional CS:GO player Cory "Semphis" Friesen, who admitted to using Adderall during a tournament. Adderall is a drug usually used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but was allegedly used to increase focus and reaction times during the $250,000 event. According to Motherboard, Semphis will not be punished as the league "can't punish someone if we are not 100 percent sure he is guilty."

The ESL's new policy will provide more conclusive testing methods and aim to protect the privacy of its players. This is not the first CS:GO scandal this year, as allegations of match fixing led to multiple player bans in January. The full policy from the ESL, including details on the testing process, will be released soon.
