The escalating demand for the rare and wild pangolin, a small ant-eating mammal, is pushing the species towards the brink of extinction, warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Highly sought after in East and Southeast Asia, pangolin scales are believed to possess medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine, with claims that they can help expel wind, reduce swelling, and boost lactation. In addition to their scales, pangolins are also prized for their meat, which has become a luxury food item for the newly affluent urban population.

All eight species of pangolin are currently at risk of extinction, with two being classified as critically endangered. This is particularly concerning considering that, unlike many other endangered species whose relatively small habitats are under threat by urbanization, pangolins can be found over a wide region, spanning across South and Southeast Asia and much of sub-Saharan Africa.

According to Dan Challender, who co-chairs IUCN's Pangolin Specialist Group, the dynamic of pangolin consumption has changed in recent years. Once a supplementary protein source for people in rural areas, pangolin meat has now become a luxury food especially in Vietnam and China, where wild meat is held in high regard. This preference for wild meat sets pangolin apart from other traditional luxury foods, such as shark fin, which have become more widely consumed as more people can afford them.

To prevent the pangolin from becoming extinct, the IUCN has come up with an extensive plan that focuses on curbing both the supply and demand of pangolin products. On the supply side, efforts are being made to increase political support for conservation measures, although this could prove to be challenging as the illegal pangolin market continues to flourish despite existing international treaties.

The action is primarily geared towards the demand side, which is substantially more difficult, as it involves changing the behavior of millions of status-conscious consumers. Nevertheless, there is still hope for the preservation of pangolins. The IUCN is exploring various strategies, such as digital-media campaigns, enlisting the help of foundations for pangolin-conservation projects, and engaging the arts community to raise awareness about the plight of pangolins.

One promising approach suggested by Challender is to persuade large corporations to refrain from consuming wild meat during contract signings and business deals, thereby setting a positive example for the public. Drawing from the success of similar campaigns, such as the anti-shark-fin efforts by WWF's Hong Kong chapter, there is potential for these tactics to reduce the demand for pangolin products and ultimately save the species from extinction.
