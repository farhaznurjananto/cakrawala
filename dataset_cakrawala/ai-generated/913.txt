Butane (n-butane) Performs well at high altitudes but burns poorly below 40 F due to poor vaporization at low temperatures. Butane is extensively used in hiking and portable stoves, lighters, tiny torches and as a propellant for aerosol cans. Boiling point: 31 F (-0.5C) (-0.5C). Gasoline will not evaporate far below its boiling point. Isobutane Isobutane is a structural isomer of butane having a lower boiling point. Manufactures claim that isobutane delivers a continuous flow without tapering off as the canister empties and is added to butane to boost its performance. Because of the increased vapor pressures of isobutane compared to butane, you may see substantially stronger gas flow. This additional pressure can cause a stove to blow itself out if it is turned up too high or possibly even harm a stove not suited for isobutane. Boiling point: 11 F (-12C) (-12C). Gasoline will not evaporate far below its boiling point. Propene ( called propylene, methylethylene and MAPP Gas) This is used for medium to heavy soldering and brazing and not meant for stove usage. It has an unusually low boiling point, which makes it viable after gas fuels used for camping fail to work in the bitter cold. Boiling point: -54 F ( 47.6C) ( 47.6C). Gasoline will not evaporate far below its boiling point. Fuel Mixes Vapor Pressure vs Temperature of Propane/IsoButane/Butane Mixes Observe the minor difference between the 3 blended Fuels displayed above The Coleman 30/70 and MSR 20/80 are almost identical here This may represent the highest pressures allowed by law for certain canisters Graph Link Isobutane and/or propane are often added to butane to allow stoves and lanterns to operate at subfreezing temperatures. These fuel blends don't effect the vaporization of butane and each fuel vaporizes
