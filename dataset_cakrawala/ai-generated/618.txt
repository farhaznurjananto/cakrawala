The tragic murder of a 19-year-old college student in Freiburg, Germany has raised concerns over the safety of citizens in countries accepting large numbers of refugees. The victim was found raped and murdered near a river, and a 17-year-old Afghan national was arrested based on DNA evidence found at the scene. The suspect has been living in Germany since 2015, with a host family providing essential support.

This devastating incident underscores the potential risks associated with integrating large migrant populations, particularly when some individuals may hold dangerous beliefs about the treatment of women, condoning acts of violence or intimidation. These individuals, originating from regions often marked by limited law enforcement and uprising, may pose a significant threat to the very citizens of the nations striving to offer them safe shelter.

Movingly, the victim had dedicated her time to supporting refugees by volunteering at a local hostel. This tragic event calls for a crucial examination of the current actions taken by European leaders to address the root of these terrifying crimes and to protect innocent lives from further harm. Both the perpetrator of this heinous act and the government must be held accountable for failing to ensure the safety of the citizens they serve.
