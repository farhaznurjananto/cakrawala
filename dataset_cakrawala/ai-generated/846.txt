First and foremost, it's wonderful to see James Hinchcliffe on the mend. As the story progressed, we gradually became aware of how terrible the situation had been. Now, we are informed that he received fourteen units of blood. This need context for a complete understanding of how well things worked for James and for drawing inferences about how things are. Even instinctively, the figure FOURTEEN PINTS is enormous. Consider that James' typical blood volume is likely approximately 5 liters (for the english unit addicts, a quart is just about a liter). A unit of red blood cells is roughly 400 milliliters. This indicates that his whole blood volume (exactly 5.6 liters) was replenished in the first 24 hours after arrival. This is the usual meaning of "large transfusion" in trauma circles; nonetheless, this term has significant consequences for care. First, some specifics. Contrary to what was stated in several headlines, the 14 blood units were not administered BEFORE arrival at the hospital. Before reaching a hospital, this quantity of blood is NEVER accessible. The infield medical center at the IMS almost definitely possesses two to four units of blood (O negative, more on this later), but there would be no blood available between there and the hospital. In addition, the conventional approach for major hemorrhage no longer includes the early transfusion of significant volumes of liquids. The charming habit of having drivers' blood types displayed on their overalls is quite lovely. No one, I repeat NO ONE, will ever be transfused on the basis of some letters sewn on his overalls. Ever. Period. Let's discuss in detail what the Holmatro team and the evac team that transported James to the hospital did and did not do. First, some context. Until to a short time ago, the accepted method for treating trauma sufferers was to follow the "A B C" sequence. Life-threatening issues were addressed in a very specific sequence. Difficulties with maintaining an open Airway were addressed prior to problems with Breathing, followed by Circulatory disturbances. Hemorrhage is by far the most common complication in terms of circulation among trauma victims. Blood loss decreases the heart's output, which in turn causes hypoperfusion of the body's numerous tissues. This indicates that they are not receiving enough oxygen and nutrients to perform normally. If this condition persists, it is known as hypovolemic (insufficient volume) shock. If this state of shock persists for too long, it becomes permanent, rendering fruitless any attempts to save the patient. During the Vietnam War in particular, advancements in military medicine led to the concept of early and vigorous fluid replacement in trauma patients. As the fundamental problem was a shortfall in circulating volume, replenishing that volume (first with relatively inexpensive and easy-to-store salt solutions) should allow cardiac output to trend upward, hence improving nutrient perfusion to tissues. This is still taught in the majority of conventional trauma courses. After completing steps A and B of the protocol, we are instructed to swiftly begin infusing trauma sufferers with massive quantities of fluid. Not only does this not work, but it actually makes the situation worse. Huh? Once again, creative physicians operating in conditions resembling a war zone (well, Houston, Texas to be precise), followed by the conflicts of the 2000s, have thrown conventional thought on its head. Initially, the A B C sequence is being altered slowly but steadily. With specific injuries (like IEDs or suspension elements severing a major artery in the thigh), it is evident that tremendous arterial bleeding will kill a patient in a matter of minutes, typically even faster than loss of airway opening. Others have therefore proposed a newer, more timely acryonym: MARCH. This matches Massive hemorrhage, Airway, Respiration, Circulation, and Head injuries. Recall Alex Zanardi's horrific accident in Lausitz in 2001? This is the second save I'm referring to when I call this article "another." Both in Germany (again, compliments to Terry Trammell and Steve Olvey) and at Indianapolis last month, rescue crews focused essentially all of their efforts on what we refer to as "exsanguinating hemorrhage" or the patient bleeding out. The second reversal of "normal" trauma care is far less intuitive, but crucial. While the concept of fast restoring a normal circulating volume (again, using simple language) seems appealing, it is not feasible.
