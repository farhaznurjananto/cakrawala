Braun Strowman is confident in his upcoming match against WWE Universal champion Brock Lesnar at No Mercy this Sunday. He predicts that victory will come and he will hold the title over his head. Success has always been important for Strowman, who states that he wants to "be the best at everything" he does in life. His passion for wrestling shines through, allowing him to work hard to achieve his dreams.

Unlike many of his peers who always dreamed of wrestling in WWE events, Strowman's journey into wrestling was a bit different. In 2012, the WWE itself approached him, recognizing his potential due to his background in competing in World's Strongest Man. Strowman's pre-wrestling years were spent playing semi-pro football, working nights as a bouncer at a Charlotte nightclub, and during the day as a mechanic. His love for wrestling began as a child, growing up as a devoted Hulk Hogan fan.

Strowman is known for his incredible work ethic and passion for wrestling. He has formed a close off-camera bond with fellow wrestler Roman Reigns, who shares the same dedication towards giving their best each night. Strowman notes, "we go out every night, we give 100 percent of what we have to go, we put our bodies on the line and we know that, at the end of the night, we’re going to have you on your feet, you’re going to be hoarse, and you’ll be going crazy because we did our job entertaining you. From top to bottom, we’re the best athletes in the world.”

Recovering from surgery on his right elbow in May, Strowman is now back to full strength in the ring and in the gym. He acknowledges the toll the intensive wrestling schedule takes on the body but is grateful for the opportunities, saying, "we do this 300 days a year, and it's a lot on the body, but I am grateful to represent the WWE."

For his dream match, Strowman would choose to wrestle one of wrestling's most legendary figures, the "Eighth Wonder of the World" Andre the Giant. Strowman said that it would be a "battle of the giants," giving fans an unforgettable spectacle.
