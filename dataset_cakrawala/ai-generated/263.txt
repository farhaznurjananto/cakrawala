President Obama and the Republicans are set to clash again over carbon emissions, climate change, and the effect it has on the US economy. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as an arm of the administration, is set to implement the first carbon pollution limits on US power plants. Previously, these limits only applied to new plants. States are tasked with creating plans to reduce emissions through cap-and-trade systems and increasing energy from renewable sources. Experts claim that this proposal will result in the biggest reduction of carbon pollution ever in the country’s history. In fact, over a dozen states are already implementing environmentally friendly policies.

The President, speaking at a Children’s National Medical Center, appealed to the public by emphasizing health benefits as a result of reducing carbon emissions. Obama stated that“in just the first year that these standards go into effect, up to 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks will be avoided – and those numbers will go up from there. As President, and as a parent, I refuse to condemn our children to a planet that’s beyond fixing.” The administration is currently trying to gain public support and calm concerns about the upcoming regulations.

Republicans oppose these regulations and warn of their impact on the economy, including job cuts. Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, a large coal-producing state, argued that “we all want clean air and clean water… We don't want costly regulations that make little or no difference, that are making things less affordable… Our pocketbook will be lighter, but our country will be darker.” 

Notably, the president rejects their claims and argues that setting high standards will push companies to find better solutions. Through increased government regulations on materials and chemicals, American businesses have responded by producing better substitutes. The American auto industry is also an example of how improved regulations led to greater innovation, with cars today being more fuel-efficient than ever before.
