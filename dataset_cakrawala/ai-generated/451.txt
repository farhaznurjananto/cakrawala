At the core of every telecom network and major data center lies the Network Operations Center (NOC), a crucial hub for monitoring all aspects of these systems. NOCs vary in presentation, with some exhibiting a more impressive aesthetic, while others maintain a simpler approach. In this article, we showcase a range of NOCs from telecom companies and data centers, providing inspiration for those in the industry.

**Dressed to Impress**

These NOCs have been designed to captivate visitors while maintaining functionality. The impressive cost to build some of these centers is evident, particularly in the case of AT&T.

- AT&T's Global NOC in Bedminster, New Jersey
- Reliance Communications' NOC in India
- Lucent's Network Reliability Center in Aurora, Colorado (1998-99)
- Conexim's NOC in Australia
- Akamai's NOC in Cambridge, Massachusetts

**Slightly More Discreet**

While still remarkable on a smaller scale, these NOCs have adopted a more conventional approach. Data centers often have more modest NOCs, whereas telecom companies may fall into the "dressed to impress" category, possibly due to the need to monitor more extensive infrastructure and please shareholders.

- Easy CGI's NOC in Pearl River, New York
- Ensynch's NOC in Tempe, Arizona
- TWAREN's NOC (Taiwan Advanced Research & Education Network)
- The Planet's NOC in Houston, Texas
- KDL's NOC in Evansville, Indiana

**The Not-Flashy-In-The-Least Award**

Rackspace stands out as a company that avoids flashy design elements in its NOC.
