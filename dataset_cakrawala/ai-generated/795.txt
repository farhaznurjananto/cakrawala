On July 15, 1837, Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was born as the daughter of Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern, and Princess Josephine of Baden. She was given the name Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Stephanie wed King Peter V of Portugal on April 29, 1858, at St. Hedwig's Cathedral in Berlin, in a ceremony that was conducted by proxy. On May 18, 1858, they went through with the wedding, which took place at the Church of St. Dominic in Lisbon. According to legend, they spent their honeymoon in Sintra, where they were said to have gone mountain hiking hand in hand. During her brief reign as Queen, she was well-known for her charitable work, and she established a number of organizations, including hospitals and charities. Stephanie was diagnosed with diphtheria after returning from a trip to Vendas Novas, and she passed away on July 17, 1859, at the young age of just 22 years old. Peter's life was irreparably altered by the loss of his wife, and he chose not to marry again. He only lived for another two years before succumbing to cholera or typhoid. The Pantheon of the Braganzas is where both of them now rest in peace.
