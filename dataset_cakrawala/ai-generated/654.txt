On Tuesday, the Indian Cabinet failed to approve the controversial National Sports Development Bill, which faced strong opposition from ministers heading sports bodies. The bill aimed to rein in sports federations and possibly gain governmental control over the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, explored several objections to the bill, leading to the decision that the sports ministry should re-work the bill before it can be reconsidered.

The National Sports Development Bill, steered by Sports Minister Ajay Maken, faced opposition primarily based on issues related to preserving the autonomy of sports organizations and age restriction for sports administrators. Among the opponents of the bill were Sharad Pawar, former BCCI chief and current ICC president; Farooq Abdullah, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association; C P Joshi, President of Rajasthan Cricket Association; and Vilasrao Deshmukh, president of the Mumbai Cricket Association. Other ministers opposing the bill included Praful Patel, chief of the All India Football Federation; Kapil Sibal; and Kamal Nath. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P Chidambaram were reportedly in favor of the bill.

Originally, the bill sought to make revolutionary changes in the functioning of sports bodies across the nation, including imposing an age limit of 70 years and tenure restrictions for administrators, as well as bringing these bodies under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. However, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and multiple other National Sports Federations vehemently opposed the bill, asserting that it constituted an attempt to interfere with the functioning of the organizations.

Additionally, the IOA stated that the move contravened the Olympic charter, potentially resulting in India being banned from international sports events if the government attempted to curb sports organizations' autonomy. Cricket administrators also raised concerns regarding the proposed bill, which aimed to place the BCCI under the purview of the RTI.

Had the Cabinet approved the bill, it could have affected the tenures of several seasoned administrators such as Suresh Kalmadi, V K Malhotra, Yashwant Sinha, Jagdish Tytler, and Virendra Nanavati, who have led their respective federations for decades. The bill could also have brought the cash-rich BCCI under its jurisdiction, although cricket administrators maintain that the legislation would not be binding on the board, which does not receive any government grants.

The sports ministry will now make adjustments to the bill, taking into consideration the objections raised by the ministers. As a result, it is unlikely that the bill will be presented during the ongoing session of Parliament. Sports Minister Maken had previously stated that the bill, once passed in Parliament, would enhance accountability in the functioning of the National Sports Federations.
