The Traditional Slovenian Breakfast campaign, launched 11 years ago by the Slovenian Beekeepers' Association, has grown to incorporate over 260,000 children attending schools and kindergartens in Slovenia and its neighboring countries. Initially created to promote honey as a healthy breakfast for school children, the campaign has expanded its focus to emphasize the importance of consuming a nutritious breakfast and encouraging the use of locally produced food.

According to Dejan Židan, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Food, almost 50% of Slovenians do not begin their day with breakfast. The campaign strives to revive the habit of eating breakfast and to highlight the benefits of local food sources. Fresh, locally produced food contributes to better overall health, while also reducing negative environmental impacts associated with transportation.

As the mindset around food choices evolves, so too does the criteria when purchasing food for public institutions, with an increasing emphasis on quality rather than simply the lowest cost. The success of the campaign is starting to become apparent, as Slovenia's nation-wide consumption of sugary fizzy drinks decreases, while the consumption of both fruits and vegetables increases.

Interestingly, Slovenia's push for healthier breakfast options has also had an impact on the international stage. Since 2014, the country has been advocating for the United Nations to designate May 20 as World Honey Bee Day in honor of Slovenian pioneer beekeeper Anton Janša's birthday. Over 100 countries have co-signed this initiative, including major powers like Russia, the United States, and China, highlighting the global reach and impact of the project.

As the Traditional Slovenian Breakfast campaign continues to grow, it is not only positively affecting the eating habits and mindfulness of food choices in Slovenia but also in neighboring countries and beyond. By promoting the importance of eating a healthy breakfast and supporting local food sources, the campaign is contributing to a more sustainable and healthier future for individuals and the environment alike.
