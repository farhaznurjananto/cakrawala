The first half of the 2015 season has been a rollercoaster ride for the two-time defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks. With a 4-4 record, the team currently occupies the third spot in the NFC West division, trailing behind the 6-2 Arizona Cardinals and the 4-3 St. Louis Rams as they head into their Week 9 bye.

Seattle's defense has regained its dominance, largely due to the return of strong safety Kam Chancellor, who ended his contract holdout after the first two games of the season. However, the offense has yet to find its rhythm, even with the acquisition of Jimmy Graham. This inconsistency can be attributed to the struggles of an unreliable offensive line.

The Seahawks' initial loss to the Rams in Week 1 foreshadowed the team's trajectory, as they relinquished a late fourth-quarter lead, ultimately losing 34-31 in overtime. It is worth noting that Seattle held the lead in all four of their losses, suffering an unusual home defeat to the currently undefeated 7-0 Carolina Panthers, who appear to be a front-runner in the NFC.

Nevertheless, having secured two consecutive victories going into the bye week and boasting a relatively healthy roster, the Seahawks seem well-positioned for a strong performance in the second half of the season.

At the beginning of the season, we identified 12 key questions that we believed would shape the 2015 campaign. As we review those questions now, we attempt to provide answers in the gallery below.

The question we asked then was:

How does Kam Chancellorâ€™s holdout play out?

Given the current state of the Seahawks, we can now provide some insight on this matter.
