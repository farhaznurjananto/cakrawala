The city of Flint lies 60 miles northwest of Detroit and has a population of about 100,000. The city’s history has been shaped by the auto industry, which directly contributed to its decline when jobs left in the 1980s. The city’s tax base declined sharply and Flint fell into a financial crisis. In 2011, Flint was taken over by a state-appointed emergency manager. The manager switched the source of the city’s water from the Detroit system to the Flint River in 2014 as a cost-saving measure.

In October 2015, a group of doctors from Hurley Medical Center in Flint published a report in the medical journal The Lancet that there had been an increase in the number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia, in the area since the switch in water sources. The report said there had been 87 cases of Legionnaires’ disease and nine deaths linked to the outbreak.

The report said the number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Flint was more than four times higher than the number in the rest of Genesee County and more than 12 times higher than the state average. The report said the outbreak appeared to be linked to the switch in water sources.
