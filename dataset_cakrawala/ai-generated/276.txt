Venezuela’s Supreme Court has recently made a decision to partially annul two controversial rulings released last Wednesday, according to a report by venezuelanalysis.com. The two rulings in question included granting the judiciary temporary powers to assume the role of the legislature and calling into question lawmakers’ parliamentary immunity – a move believed to be a violation of the country’s Constitution.

This comes after an urgent meeting was held by the National Security Council on Friday night, convened by President Nicolas Maduro, in a bid to resolve a growing institutional crisis between the country’s legislature, judiciary and the Attorney General, Luisa Ortega. The situation is rooted in the approval of two rulings earlier this week in relation to the status of the National Assembly, which the judiciary currently deems to be in contempt of court.

In response, Wednesday’s TSJ rulings granted temporary rights to the judiciary to assume the role of the National Assembly until the situation is resolved, as well as stating that National Assembly legislators do not hold eligibility for parliamentary immunity in recognition of the violation. The legality of these decisions prompted heated debate. While Attorney General Ortega described it as “a rupture of the Constitutional order,” the rulings were deemed legal by former Public Prosecutors and the Venezuelan Ombudsman.

Six immediate decisions were subsequently put forward by the National Security Council in an effort to end the impasse. The council's resolutions ratify the Supreme Court as "the competent body for the control of Constitutionality in relation to any National Public Power which collides with the Magna Carta, as well as for the resolution of conflicts between powers", however, it urged the TSJ to review the two controversial rulings in the interests of institutional stability and the balance of powers.

It also called on the opposition – grouped under the coalition the Roundtable of Democratic Unity – to agree to participate in national dialogue with the government facilitated by the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Vatican “without delay”. In addition, the Council expressed its “categorical rejection of any intervention” against the country’s independence, territorial integrity, and self-determination, stating that “the matters of Venezuelans must be resolved exclusively by us”.

President Maduro disclosed that council members “conversed with Attorney General Luisa Ortega” while President of the Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, President of the court’s Constitutional Tribunal Juan José Mendoza, Vice-President Tareck El Aissami, Ombudsman Tarek William Saab, Comptroller General of the Republic Manuel Galindo, Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez, and Planning Minister Ricardo Menendez, all participated in the meeting. The de-facto President of the National Assembly, Julio Borges, was also invited but refused to attend in protest of the “constitutional rupture.” Borges indicated that the opposition will not participate in dialogue with the government, nor take part in efforts to address the country’s institutional crisis, unless its demands for immediate elections have been met.

National dialogue between the government and the opposition was suspended late last year after opposition delegates called time on the talks when the government refused to meet demands for immediate national elections and the release of approximately 100 “political prisoners”. Although national elections are not due until 2018, the opposition is pushing for them to be brought forward, citing the country’s ongoing economic crisis. The regional elections, which were scheduled to take place last year, were postponed until 2017 by the National Electoral Council. However, the dates for the elections have not yet been set by the electoral body.

Yesterday, several opposition legislators submitted an official lawsuit to the Public Prosecution against the seven judges sitting on the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Tribunal. The Supreme Court is expected to release an alternative ruling shortly in relation to its deadlock with the National Assembly although its website was unavailable at the time of writing.
