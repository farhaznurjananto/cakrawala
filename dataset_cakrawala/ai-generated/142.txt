PRODUCER'S NOTE It's been one week since we launched our Indiegogo campaign for Shatterbug, and we're already at 44% of our goal! Thank you so much for all your support. We're thrilled to see that people are excited about the project.

Please help us keep the momentum going by spreading the word.

We're also thrilled to have at least one person donate to us in every single country in the world (except North Korea and Sudan)! That's pretty amazing.

We hope to have more updates for you soon (and maybe even some sneak peeks of the product).
