 BEIJING - Ignoring reports that Chinese President Xi Jinping's first visit to Pakistan has been canceled, China said today that the visit has not been officially announced. 
 
 “We have not officially released any information about Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan. So there is no reason to say  we canceled the trip.” Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said at a press briefing. Qin answered questions about President Xi Jinping's visit being canceled due to security concerns following continued anti-government protests in Pakistan. 
 Although not officially  announced, President Xi Jinping will visit Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India in  the middle of this month. “China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. We enjoy  friendship and cooperation in various fields in any weather. The two countries maintain close cooperation at a high level. Spokesman Jin said that on the issue of high-level visits between the two countries, close contact is being made at the next stage. 
 China has  twice urged the Pakistani government and protesters to resolve their differences through dialogue. Jin again called for political reconciliation in Pakistan to maintain domestic stability. "We hope that all relevant parties in Pakistan will work together to maintain internal stability," he said.
