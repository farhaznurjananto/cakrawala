The addition of Roman Hamrlik to the New York Rangers' defense comes at a critical time for the team. The Rangers have been struggling to break into the top ranks of the Eastern Conference and their recent loss of Staal only further complicated matters. As a leader on the team, Staal's absence on the ice has undoubtedly been felt by his teammates, so the Rangers organization had to take action to fill the gap. 

Hamrlik could be the perfect fit. Despite his age, he brings years of experience to the team. He began his professional career with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 1992 and has played for eight different teams throughout his NHL career. Over the years, he has played in more than 1,300 games, scoring 155 goals and 483 assists. He has also served as captain for the Czech national team in several international competitions.

However, the veteran defenseman has had a slow start with the Washington Capitals this season. In fact, he's only played in four games, being a healthy scratch for 16 of the team's 20 games. When it became apparent that Hamrlik wasn't going to see much ice time with the Capitals this season, they placed him on waivers. Despite his lack of playing time recently, the Rangers were quick to jump on the opportunity to add him to their roster.

Hamrlik's acquisition could be an important move for the Rangers. Not only does he bring a wealth of experience to the team, but he also has a solid track record of staying healthy. Over the past eight seasons, he has missed only eleven games. By contrast, Staal has had a history of injuries, including a concussion that kept him off the ice for much of last season. 

While nothing is confirmed yet, there is hope that Staal may not be out of the game for too long. The Rangers' management has promised to provide updates on his condition soon, and Staal himself expressed confidence yesterday that he would be back soon. Even so, the Rangers organization has made it clear that they need to have a solid backup plan in place to keep the team's chances of making the playoffs alive. 

The Rangers are currently fifth in the Eastern Conference, trailing the Pittsburgh Penguins by only four points. There is no doubt that every game from here on out is critical for the team's success. By claiming Hamrlik off waivers, the Rangers have positioned themselves to be in a better position to compete for a spot in the playoffs. Of course, only time will tell whether that decision will have the impact they are hoping for. But with Hamrlik's experience, his reputation as a solid defenseman, and his clean bill of health, it seems like a worthwhile risk for the Rangers to take.
