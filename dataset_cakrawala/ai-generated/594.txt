Drivers often struggle to see bikers on the road, regardless of whether they are riding bicycles or motorcycles. This lack of visibility frequently leads to accidents, with drivers frequently claiming they did not see the biker at all. While there are various solutions to address this issue, such as wearing high-visibility gear, one product stands out both for its effectiveness and its innovative design.

Introducing the Active Side Lighting kit from Lunasee, this upgraded version boasts three times more LED-powered illumination than the standard system. Not only is the kit incredibly eye-catching, but its futuristic design is so appealing that many are considering purchasing it just for its aesthetic value.

The kit works by placing four one-watt high-powered LEDs on the front and rear of the bike, aimed at the wheel's rim. Additionally, a strip of photo-luminescent LunaGlo tape is applied to both sides of the wheel, which is charged by the LED lights. Within a matter of seconds, the strips begin glowing, greatly increasing the visibility of the bike and rider.

The Lunasee Pro 1000 kit, priced at $159.95, provides everything a frequent night rider could need to improve their visibility and safety on the road. For those interested in customizing their bicycle or motorcycle, various colored rim tape options will be available for $24.95 early in the upcoming year. Overall, the Lunasee Pro 1000 offers a more effective and stylish method to ensure bikers are seen by drivers than loud exhaust pipes, neon lights, or performing risky stunts.
