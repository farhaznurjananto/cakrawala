Marine Le Pen, member of the European Parliament and the Presidential candidate for France, has been stripped off her parliamentary immunity. The decision comes after she tweeted three highly graphic images of ISIS executions in 2015, which included the beheading of US journalist James Foley. French judiciary requested the European Parliament to lift her immunity, which was approved by the lawmakers in the legal affairs committee. The issue was then taken to a full chamber vote on Thursday, which resulted in Le Pen losing her immunity. 

The decision by the European Parliament means that Marine Le Pen can now face prosecution, paving the way for legal action to be taken against her. The offence being considered is “publishing violent images," which under certain circumstances can carry a penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros. 

This is not the first time Le Pen's immunity has been lifted. It was lifted once before in 2013, where she was prosecuted in 2015 for "incitement to discrimination over people's religious beliefs." The charges were eventually recommended to be dropped. 

The decision is a big blow to Le Pen, who is running for the French presidency, and is also controversial in the context of the European Union’s policy on freedom of speech. The vote has brought forth debates on whether freedom of speech applies to the content of social media posts of elected officials, even if it involves shocking images. 

The reaction from Marine Le Pen is still awaited. It remains to be seen how the outcome of the proceedings will impact her electoral campaign.
