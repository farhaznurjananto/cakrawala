The fact that the United States Court of Appeals has decided to send a recent voter ID case back to the Federal District Court, which is a lower court, is an acknowledgment of the fact that obtaining a voter ID can be so difficult for some people that it may prevent them from voting, which is against both state and federal law. Because of the way the law is currently written, some voters are unable to obtain a photo identification card, so the Court of Appeals ordered the lower court to figure out a way to give them the right to vote without providing one. Those of us who did not advocate for the adoption of this proposal are not taken aback by this development. Every eligible resident of Wisconsin possesses the right to vote, and it is not the responsibility of any political party to erect obstacles in the way of individuals who express an interest in casting a ballot. Multiple instances have demonstrated that it is a fallacy to believe that voter fraud occurs in actual elections. There is no evidence of voter fraud, according to the Attorney Generals, Judges, and District Attorneys. It really boils down to this: voting is not a high-payoff crime for criminals, and the rare person in our state of 5 million people who votes more than once is discovered and brought to justice, as was the case with Republican Robert Monroe. To summarize the decision, even though the court ruled that requiring people to obtain a valid photo ID in order to vote does not constitute an undue burden, the process is still far too difficult for people. Some individuals may even be placed into classes or groups of people who are unable to obtain a valid ID that satisfies the requirements established by the Wisconsin law. Even though the court is only addressing three groups in this action, some people may argue that there are other groups that have an extremely hard time getting a government-issued ID in order to vote. This decision throws open the doors. People who live on the streets, in shelters, or on the couches of friends and family are frequently unable to produce a valid form of identification. This is also true of people who move frequently for a variety of reasons. Being transient does not make an individual ineligible to vote. Since 2008, the number of people in Wisconsin who are experiencing homelessness has increased every year, and recent estimates put the number of homeless people in Wisconsin at at least 25,000. In this decision, the court acknowledged that obtaining a valid photo ID can be an exceptionally difficult task for certain categories of citizens who wish to exercise their voting rights. My expectation is that in light of this decision and whatever transpires in the subsequent proceedings in the lower court, there will be a way forward that paves the way for everyone to have the right to vote. The fact that there is no legislative remedy available is not a valid justification for the court to turn a blind eye to the recognized and actual flaws in the law. In accordance with the Constitution and the doctrine of the "balance of the powers," the job of the courts is to interpret the law. This law was approved by the Republican-controlled legislature, which vowed repeatedly that "not a single voter would be displaced by this law." To ensure that this is the case, it is the responsibility of the judicial system.
