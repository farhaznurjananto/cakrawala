Identical 16-year-old twins Taylor and Tricia (played by one actress) are the daughters of a widowed working mother who has worked hard to make a life for herself and her daughters. Her mother's work has meant that she has been largely absent from the lives of her daughters, who have been brought up largely by their grandparents. When their mother is diagnosed with a terminal illness, the twins make a pact to find their father and bring him back into their lives before she dies. However, as they begin their search they discover that their father is a man with a dark past who may not be the man they thought he was.
