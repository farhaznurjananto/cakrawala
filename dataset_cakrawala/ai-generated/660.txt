Every year, the University of Pennsylvania's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) organizes two public events on campus. The first is a memorial for the Palestinians killed in Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces. A single black flag is placed for each victim in front of the main campus building. The second event is a mock wall demonstration, symbolizing the actual 155-kilometer-long wall separating Israel and the West Bank. Posters covering the mock wall explain its illegality under international law and the impact on Palestinians living behind it.

In an effort to honor those lost in the Israeli occupation of Palestine and to make our minority voice heard on a predominantly pro-Israel campus, our members and demonstrations have faced routine backlash, including harassment, threats of physical harm, and angry observers uprooting our memorial in protest.

Recently, an op-ed in our school newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, written by the past president of the pro-Israel group on campus, referred to our Gaza memorial as "noise" and "propaganda." Consequently, the Palestinian students involved in the SJP wrote an op-ed detailing their experiences as Palestinians on campus, living within "the noise."

The Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) at Penn also responded to the original op-ed, but despite being directly targeted, our article was not given priority in publication. Therefore, we would like to share the op-ed we originally submitted and the accounts of three Palestinian students at our university.

One student reflects on the pain and dislocation felt by Palestinians in their diaspora, as they long for the homeland from which they were expelled. Another recounts the humiliation and restrictions on mobility that Palestinians in the West Bank endure, being forced to stay confined behind the separation wall, unable to visit their homes and experience life outside. Lastly, a Christian Palestinian citizen of Israel describes the struggles of existing as "the other" in their ancestral homeland.

We, the Palestinian students of Penn Students for Justice in Palestine, are the ones who planned the memorial that was called noise. Our stories are not exceptional. We share them for those who cannot tell their own. These stories are more than just noise â€” they are the reason we raise our voices.
