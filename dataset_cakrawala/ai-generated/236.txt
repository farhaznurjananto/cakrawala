Ikea is an international household name that has been the talk of the town recently for its environmentally damaging logging processes. The company operates primarily with wood, and it seems this practice has come at a cost of troubling environmental destruction. According to environmental organizations, Ikea's wholly owned subsidiary, Swedwood, is responsible for the logging and clear-cutting of old-growth forests in the north of Russian Karelia, inevitably resulting in the destruction of ancient and unique forests with high conservation value.

Whilst the issue has received great attention in recent news publications, Ikea has promoted the "We Love Wood" slogan for years, proclaiming that they only use wood obtained in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable way. Recent reports have proved this declaration is a complete myth. For instance, an investigative report by Swedish public service television indicates that Swedwood, Ikea's subsidiary, cut down 1,400 acres of forest every year. The consequences of logging these ancient forests have deep ramifications on invaluable forest ecosystems. Protect the Forest, Sweden, a nature conservation organization, has documented that Ikea, through Swedwood, clear-cut areas of old-growth forest containing 200-600 year-old trees in the northwest of Karelia near the Finnish border.

The belt of virgin forest in Russia, along with the tropical rainforests along the equator, performs vital functions for life on earth: they bind huge amounts of carbon dioxide and are home to hundreds of thousands of unique animal and plant species. Therefore, it is a crying shame that such valuable ecosystems are being destroyed by commercial giants like Ikea. Even more concerning is the fact that Swedwood is certified by the international forestry organization Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which claims to ensure "responsibly managed forests."

On paper FSC has strict rules for certification that ensure protection of ancient forests. But in reality there are some gaps in regulation, according to Andrei Ptichnikov, the general manager of FSC in Russia. However, Anders Hildeman, forest manager at Ikea, acknowledged the charges but stood by the company line that Ikea takes high conservation values into account when they plan their logging, and Swedwood was the first FSC-certified company in Karelia in 2006. According to him, FSC certification is a good basis for responsible forest management. 

In conclusion, the conservation of old-growth forests is an essential aspect of environmentalism, and while the destruction we have seen at the hands of Ikea and Swedwood might not necessarily be illegal, it is a breach of ecological and moral responsibility. Protecting old-growth forests is not only down to organizations like Forest Stewardship Council, but a moral responsibility of commercial giants like Ikea to ensure sustainable ecological practice. The consequences of logging on these precious ecosystems are devastating, not only for the planet but for the future of families and communities in Russian Karelia.
