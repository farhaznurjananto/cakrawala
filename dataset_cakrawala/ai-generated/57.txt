Welcome to the Sunday Giveaway, the place where we giveaway a new Android phone or tablet each and every Sunday!

A big congratulations to last week’s winner of the ASUS ZenFone 2E giveaway: Christoph S. (Germany)

This week we are giving away a brand new LG G3 Stylus, courtesy of the AA Deals Store.

LG’s latest smartphone-tablet hybrid, the G3 Stylus, is a device that is designed to appeal to a very specific niche. It is a relatively low-cost smartphone that comes with a built-in stylus, a large display, and a design similar to the company’s current flagship.

The LG G3 Stylus features a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels, a 1.3GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and a 3,000 mAh battery. On the back there is a 13-megapixel camera, and on the front there is a 1.3-megapixel camera.

Good luck!
