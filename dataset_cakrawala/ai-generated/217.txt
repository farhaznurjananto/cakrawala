Mail Online, an online network of Associated Newspapers, has recently surpassed the Huffington Post to become the second most popular news website in the world, according to new figures from metrics firm comScore. With Arianna Huffington's groundbreaking news and opinion website, which was purchased by AOL for $315 million (Â£193 million) in February, being leapfrogged by Mail Online, the latter now stands behind only the New York Times in comScore's "newspapers" category.

Mail Online's popularity has soared exponentially over the past three years, in part due to its showbiz-laden front page, which has essentially positioned it as a preferred destination for celebrity gossip. However, the network's focus on US news, as well as its ability to channel interesting stories about ordinary people happening outside the network's typical coverage areas, have also contributed considerably towards its success. To bolster its online news operation, Associated Newspapers has been hiring editorial staff in New York and Los Angeles. 

According to comScore, Mail Online's unique visitors witnessed a whopping 27% increase between February and March this year, climbing to a staggering 39,635,000 visitors. In contrast, the Huffington Post recorded a much modest 20% increase, to a total of 38,429,000 unique visitors within the same period.

It is important to note that Mail Online remains the most popular newspaper website in the UK. However, based on the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations Electronic, the site suffered a slight drop in UK online traffic in February, the first one observed in a period of sustained growth.

Meanwhile, the New York Times still holds a comfortable lead as the most popular English-language news site in March. The newspaper's unparalleled success can be attributed to a remarkable month in global news, as it witnessed a 41% rise in traffic as compared to February, reaching a record of 61,964,000 unique visitors. However, that figure is expected to drop after the New York Times introduced its long-awaited metered subscription service on 28 March. Although the NYT executives have been careful to only charge the heaviest users of the site, the metering method will most likely affect regular users who also visit the site quite frequently.

Presently, the Tribune Newspapers network of websites ranks fourth in popularity for March, with a total of 34,624,000 unique visitors, according to comScore. The fifth most-read English-language website in the world during this period was Guardian.co.uk, which is part of the group that publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk. It had a total of 30,891,000 users. Incidentally, the Guardian recently announced plans for an extended digital operation in the US, which will be under the leadership of Guardian.co.uk's edtor Janine Gibson. As per comScore metrics from February 2011, the Guardian enjoys an online audience of about 8 million users in the US.
