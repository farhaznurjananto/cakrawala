In a recent, in-depth interview on "Oprah's Next Chapter," actress Lindsay Lohan opened up to Oprah Winfrey about her struggles with addiction, revealing that alcohol has been the primary source of her difficulties, rather than cocaine. Lohan's candid discussion about her past substance abuse issues provided a glimpse into the reality of her experiences, which have often been shrouded in media speculation.

In the past, Lohan had claimed that she had only tried cocaine three or four times. However, during her conversation with Winfrey, she bravely admitted to downplaying her experiences with the drug: "I really haven't done it more than 10 to 15 times," Lohan shared. "Of course, I said three or four. I was terrified of being judged."

She went on to explain the role that cocaine played in her addictive behavior, stating that she primarily used the drug to provide necessary energy to sustain her excessive alcohol consumption. "I only snorted the drug and mainly used it so I could have the energy to keep drinking," Lohan revealed.

Following a court-mandated stint in rehab, Lohan has been attempting to rebuild her career and regain her footing in the entertainment industry. Her appearance on Winfrey's show, as well as her guest-hosting gig on "Chelsea Lately," have been crucial steps in her efforts to mount a successful comeback.

During the interview with Winfrey, Lohan spoke openly about the central role that alcohol has played in exacerbating her personal struggles and contributing to a hard-partying lifestyle that severely disrupted her once-promising career. "Alcohol," Lohan admitted. "That, in the past, was a gateway to other things for me."

Furthermore, Lohan reflected on her troubled past, attributing her addictive tendencies to her tumultuous childhood. The actress recounted a series of family-related traumas, including her parents' multiple separations and eventual divorce, as well as her father Michael's legal issues. Lohan's willingness to delve into her personal history and confront the root causes of her addictive personality provided a heartbreaking yet insightful look into the life of someone grappling with the complexities and challenges of addiction, fame, and personal turmoil.
