More recent information is included in this 2011 update. You may have forgotten, but the holidays will soon be here. This implies that members of the Salvation Army will be aggressively soliciting money from generous consumers on behalf of the poor and downtrodden. The Salvation Army, alas, helps only the deserving (as they see it) of society. While many think of the group as just another charity, in truth the group is a religious sect that is notoriously anti-gay; you shouldn't give to the Salvation Army this holiday season if you support gay rights. The Salvation Army turned us down when my ex-boyfriend and I were homeless because they said they couldn't support our "sinful homosexual lifestyle" if we stayed together. As we refused to end our relationship despite their repeated demands, we were forced to sleep on the sidewalks. My eyes have been opened to the bigotry that the Salvation Army teaches. Still need more evidence? You may get a comprehensive rundown of the Salvation Army's anti-gay stances and policies in the video that follows the break. You'll be astounded, and after that you won't be dropping any more cash into the giant red troughs.
