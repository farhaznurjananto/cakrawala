MediaTek has just added two new SoC (system-on-chip) products to its Helio X20 lineup of mobile processors. The new chips are the Helio X22 and Helio X25, and they are based on the company's all-new deca-core CPU, the Cortex-A72.

The Helio X22 is the more powerful of the two, featuring four Cortex-A72 cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz, four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.85GHz, and two Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.4GHz.

The Helio X25, on the other hand, features a slightly lower-clocked version of the Cortex-A72 CPU, with three cores clocked at up to 2.5GHz, four cores clocked at up to 1.85GHz, and two cores clocked at up to 1.4GHz.

The Helio X22 and Helio X25 are both manufactured using TSMC's 16nm FinFET process, and they feature MediaTek's Imagination Technologies-licensed PowerVR G71 MP2 GPU.

The Helio X22 and Helio X25 will be available in the second quarter of 2017, and they will be priced at $199 and $299, respectively.
