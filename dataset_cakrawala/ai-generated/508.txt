Texas Senator Ted Cruz is asserting his position as a strong contender in the GOP's 2016 race. Cruz has urged fellow candidates Marco Rubio and John Kasich to withdraw, emphasizing that his campaign is the only one capable of consistently overcoming current front-runner Donald Trump. Cruz has recently achieved victories in Kansas, Maine, Texas, Iowa, Alaska, and Oklahoma. In the latest delegate count, Trump holds a lead of 382, compared to 300 for Cruz; Rubio maintains 128, while Kasich has 35. A total of 1,237 delegates are required to secure the Republican nomination for president. The narrow competition between Trump and Cruz, coupled with Rubio's less successful bid, has sparked speculation that a brokered convention could occur for the first time since 1952. However, Cruz has dismissed this as a highly unlikely scenario.
