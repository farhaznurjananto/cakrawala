Scientists from the US National Academy of Sciences have discovered a fourth pre-historic virus, Mollivirus Sibericum, in the melting Siberian permafrost. This finding has raised concerns about the potential revival of ancient, potentially pathogenic viruses due to climate change and human activity. Before reactivating the virus, a French research team will first determine if it could cause disease in animals or humans.

Jean-Michel Claverie, one of the researchers, issued a warning regarding the exploitation of oil and other mineral resources in permafrost regions. He believes that such activities could lead to the reemergence of long-dormant viruses, like smallpox, that were previously thought to be eradicated. In 2013, the same research team discovered a giant virus called Pithovirus Sibericum at the same location and remarkably, managed to revive it in a petri dish.

Mollivirus Sibericum and other ancient virus specimens have astonished scientists with their remarkable genetic complexity. M. Sibericum contains over 500 genes, while the Pandoravirus, discovered in 2003, has 2,500. Comparatively, the Influenza A virus has just eight genes. This discovery highlights the potential risks and implications of human activity on permafrost regions that contain such genetically complex, ancient viruses.
