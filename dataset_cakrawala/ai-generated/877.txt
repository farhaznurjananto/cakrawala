Scampia, a northern Neapolitan suburb, is notorious for its drug wars, clan battles, and an ever-growing casualty list. But the long-suffering area was at the center of a different kind of conflict over the weekend, when a war of words erupted between its local politicians and Italy's most prominent anti-mafia campaigner over the filming of a television series based on the 2008 hit film Gomorrah. Scampia's local council chief, Angelo Pisani, has said that in order to protect the area and its residents from disproportionately bad publicity, he will not allow cameras into the neighborhood for the making of the upcoming drama, which will be called Gomorrah after Roberto Saviano's chilling expos of the Neapolitan underworld, which spawned Matteo Garrone's film. "It's time to stop exploiting Naples and this area in particular," Pisani told the Corriere del Mezzogiorno. "It cannot be denied that constant exaggeration of the negative things that exist solves nothing; on the contrary, it worsens the problems and confirms the stigma." While the mayor of Naples, Luigi de Magistris, had no involvement in Pisani's decision, he supported it. "We are tired of seeing Scampia reduced to a place of conquest for the warring Camorra, as if nothing else existed in Scampia beyond the drug-pushing and the feuding clans," he said, likening the Gomorrah effect on the local area to a "negative media brand" that he claimed had left locals "exasperated". To Saviano, the Naples-born writer and Camorra scourge, this smacked of "pure, sly censorship" aimed at diverting attention away from Scampia's problems and politicians' inability to solve them. "How can you wish to obstruct the recounting of the contradictions of a place that, in fact, should be at the forefront of national interest every day?" he asked in a scathing column for La Repubblica. Saviano, who has played a supervisory role in the 12-part series, accused local politicians of "shifting attention from the problem to the recounting of the problem". "When nothing changes due to incompetent management," he continued, "it is better [for politicians] that the organs of the press, writers' pens, and directors' TV cameras remain silent, switched off, idle, and still." Filming for the television series, produced by Fandango and Cattleya for Sky Italia, is set to begin in the coming weeks. A Catteleya spokesman expressed surprise at the decision, especially given that only a small portion of the series would be set in Scampia. Saviano's book, published in 2006, and Garrone's subsequent film were credited with bringing the powerful Neapolitan mafia to the attention of the world. Scampia, on the other hand, remains deeply troubled, the site of ongoing bloody turf wars between rival Camorra factions over multimillion-pound drug markets. Last week, one of the area's most notorious fugitives, Antonio Mennetta, 28, was arrested in a villa near Salerno. He has been on the run from murder and criminal conspiracy charges since September, and police have described him as the leader of the powerful Girati clan of Scampia.
