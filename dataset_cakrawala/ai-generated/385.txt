Sarah Lucas, the leader of the group "Australia for Dolphins," brought a lawsuit against the Taiji Whale Museum in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Ms. Lucas claims that she and her father were "rudely and aggressively escorted" from the museum in February, while watching a dolphin show. She said they were escorted out simply because they were anti-whaling activists. Lucas explained that she and her father had returned to the museum days later, only to be confronted by a museum ticket officer showing them a sign that read: "No anti-whalers are allowed inside the museum."

Lucas is seeking Â¥7 ($69,000 USD) million in damages, and the lawsuit also accuses the museum of violating Japanese law, which prohibits discrimination based on race or religion. The lawsuit claims that the museum's barring of "foreign-looking visitors" violates various statutes including the constitution and international covenants on human rights.

The museum's director, Katsuki Hayashi, said that "we welcome (foreigners) who are clearly tourists. We aim to protect the town's culture, assets, and fishery." Meanwhile, the plaintiff lawyer Takashi Takano said in the court, "It is unforgivable for them (the museum) to accept only those whose thoughts are likable for them." Takano went on to make it clear that it is against various statutes including the constitution and international covenants on human rights.

Taiji, known for its annual dolphin hunt, has become a flashpoint in a fight by activists to stop Japan's whaling programme and the town's dolphin slaughter. In the annual hunt, local fishermen corral hundreds of dolphins into a secluded bay to kill them for meat or sell them to aquariums. The hunt has attracted condemnation from around the world, yet defenders of the deadly hunt claim it is a tradition and argue that the animals are not endangered. They further claim that Western objections are hypocritical, as Western countries also kill animals for food, including cows and pigs.

The next court hearing is set for mid-September.
