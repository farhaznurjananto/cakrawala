The ExoPlanets At the initiative of the IAU, the ExoWorlds list of exoplanets and their host stars available for public naming is a compilation of numerous exoplanet databases, notably exoplanet.eu [2] and exoplanets.org [3]. This list contains the well-studied exoplanets identified during the past two decades, as of December 31, 2008. A period of at least five years from the discovery has been regarded as a simple and sufficient requirement for including exoplanets as confirmed. All of the discoveries were made utilizing diverse techniques, including as radial velocities, transits, microlensing, and direct photography. The scientific nomenclature for these exoplanets adheres to the nomenclature norms widely accepted by the scientific community, which are derived from the criteria for identifying binary stars. For each planet, the host star's name is followed by a lowercase letter: b for the first exoplanet identified, c for the second, and so on. (In the case of binaries, the letters are capitalized: the "primary" star name is followed by "A," and its partner stars are labeled by the same name followed by "B," "C," etc. Five stars on the ExoWorlds list already have popular names: Fomalhaut (alpha Piscis Austrini) is one of the four "royal stars" of ancient Persia, together with Aldebaran, Antares, and Regulus. Pollux (beta Geminorum) is the twin brother of Castor, son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda (Gemini means twins in latin). gamma Cephei (Errai, Arabic for shepherd), epsilon Tauri (Ain, Arabic for bull's eye), and iota Draconis also have common names (Edasich, Arabic also). These stars are also known by common names in other civilizations [1]. Thus, these five stars are not eligible for public naming. References [1] P. Kunitzsch and T.
