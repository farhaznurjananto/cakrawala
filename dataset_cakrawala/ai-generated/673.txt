Golden State Warriors' forward Draymond Green's participation in Wednesday night's game against the Memphis Grizzlies remains uncertain as he continues to suffer from a persistent shoulder injury. However, the team's general manager, Bob Myers, has expressed optimism about Green's imminent return in the upcoming matches this week.

Myers shared his thoughts on Green's condition during an interview on 95.7 The Game, explaining, "He wanted to play today, but he's being cautious. I'd expect him back on Friday (against the Los Angeles Lakers) or Saturday (against the Denver Nuggets)." He further noted that Green has become more conscientious about his injury compared to the early stages of his career.

Green first experienced shoulder pain about two weeks ago. Despite missing the Warriors' victory over the Charlotte Hornets on December 6, he returned to play a pivotal role in their win against the Detroit Pistons. In that game, Green managed to overcome a 1-for-6 shooting performance by delivering 13 assists, six rebounds, six blocks, and three steals.

Having missed the Warriors' last three games, Green's lack of progress is a source of concern for head coach Steve Kerr. However, Kerr remains confident that there is no serious cause for alarm at present. Significantly, Green was seen practicing his shots at a shoot-around session on Wednesday morning, hinting at a possible return to the court soon.
