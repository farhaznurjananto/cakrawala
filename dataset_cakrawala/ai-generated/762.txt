3.6 5 5 5 No. 7 Males Energising Moisturiser An outstanding value product that, when used daily, visibly improves the appearance, odor, and feel of fatigued skin. September 29, 2014 Excellent product! I've been use this for months, and it's fantastic! I wish I'd utilized it earlier! I use a small amount of moisturizer three times a day (essentially after each meal); it makes me feel clean and smells nice. I had had dry hands for years as a result of my prior employment, but I can now feel them becoming moisturized again for a very modest cost. The tube may be small (could be SLIGHTLY larger!) but it lasts me approximately two to three weeks. December 28, 2014
