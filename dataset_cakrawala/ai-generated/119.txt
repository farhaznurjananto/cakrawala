California farmers now must abide by a 3 percent salinity-level standard and are working toward a 1 percent standard.

The state's coastal stream salinity standards are designed to protect a variety of species, including steelhead and salmon.

"The water quality in the San Joaquin River and its tributaries is extremely important to the state's economy and its environment," said Jane Diamond, director of the state's Water Resources Control Board. "We are committed to working with the agricultural industry to ensure that the salinity standards are met."

The state has established a water-quality monitoring program in the San Joaquin River and its tributaries.

The U.S. Geological Survey and CalFed, a state-federal partnership, are conducting the program.

The program will help farmers and others comply with the state's salinity standards.

The program will also help scientists understand the impact of agricultural practices on water quality and the health of aquatic species.

The 3 percent salinity-level standard applies to all surface water in the state, including rivers, creeks and streams.

The 1 percent salinity-level standard applies to all groundwater and irrigation water in the state.

The state began enforcing the 3 percent salinity-level standard in July 2009.

The 1 percent salinity-level standard will take effect in 2020.
