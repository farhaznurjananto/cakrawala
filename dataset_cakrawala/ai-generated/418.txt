A seminar called "Big Dig" is being held for Christian apologetics, aimed at teenagers who have left the church. The seminar is being organized by satellite and internet providers of training content for churches, CCN, in partnership with Focus on the Family, an ultra-conservative religious organization based in Colorado Springs. The reason for the seminar is due to a majority of flock waking up and leaving the church after graduating from high school. Reports show between 64 and 94 percent of Christian teens leave the Church within a few years of graduating high school. The seminar may be too late for Christians since atheism is the fastest-growing theological perspective in America.

To be an atheist is to not believe in a super-natural entity; it's the opposite of being superstitious. Instead, believers in God are making believe there is a God. Every society and culture around the world has created their own God that looks like them, acts like them, and has the same personality attributes. Therefore, it's understandable why many people are turning towards atheism.

The "Big Dig" seminar costs $30 per ticket, but local venues are reducing prices to try and get rid of them since nobody wants to spend early summer vacation mornings hearing about Christianity; now, Elk Grove Baptist Church is selling their tickets for $10. Elk Grove Baptist Church says over 80% of students who grow up attending good churches will fall away from their faith as young adults. However, they remain tight-lipped on what they define as bad churches and how they are different from good churches.

Atheism is becoming a significant trend, and more and more college professors believe the Bible is a book of myths and fables. The younger generation is becoming more educated and enlightened about religion, making them less susceptible to religious propaganda. Rob Sherman's website, Godless in Chicago, promotes active dialogue about atheism and non-belief in a God. The website has quadrupled its page views, and is encouraging readers to share their thoughts on atheism and religion.
