Melting permafrost has exposed bizarre holes in the soil of Siberia. The resemblance of these holes to the mouth of hell does nothing to assuage human fears of the impending apocalypse. The Batagaika crater in Siberia, known as the "doorway to the underworld," is approximately 1 kilometer in length and 86 meters in depth. It is also expanding rapidly! Frank Gnther of the Alfred Wegener Institute discovered that the crater has grown an average of 10 meters per year over the past decade. The sudden appearance of a crater in Siberia prompted the locals to rename this area "The Gate to the Underworld!" pic.twitter.com/JXb1ZmLrSG 5 March 2017 - John Moffitt (@JohnRMoffitt) The craters or'megaslumps' left behind by the melting of permafrost reveal long-buried forests, animal remains, and climate records spanning hundreds of thousands of years. In 2016, scientist Julian Murton explained to Motherboard what the layers reveal about the climate. The Batagaika site contains a remarkably thick sequence of permafrost deposits, including two wood-rich layers interpreted as forest beds and indicating past climates that were as warm or warmer than the climate today. The entrance to the underworld Local Yakutians gave the city the moniker "gateway to the underworld." Yet for scientists, it's a portal to at least 200,000 years ago, revealing how climate change has shaped the region since the last ice age. In addition, Gnther expressed his concerns to BBC News regarding the carbon that the crater may expose. Global estimations of carbon stored in permafrost is [the] same amount as what's in the atmosphere. The gas in the atmosphere, will increase the warming climate that has melted the permafrost. In turn, this will deepen the crater and release additional carbon into the atmosphere. You have the concept. More: 5 amazing unsolved mysteries
