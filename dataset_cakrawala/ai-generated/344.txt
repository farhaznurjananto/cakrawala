Leading companies in the food and drink industry have promised to halve the total amount of food they waste globally by 2025 to pre-empt government sanctions. The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), consisting of some 400 large retailers, manufacturers and other stakeholders from 70 nations, has pledged to decrease the quantity of food wasted during production and transportation, as well as seeking to increase the utilization of remaining waste. This comes after concern was raised regarding the severe environmental, economic and social costs and inefficiencies of food waste. Paul Bulcke, CEO of the largest food and beverage company Nestle, has said that by reducing food waste, natural resources, particularly water, can be conserved, in addition to combating climate change by limiting the increase of global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has revealed that around $750bn of food - equivalent to a third of all food produced worldwide - is wasted per annum. The CGF hopes to establish a baseline for 2016 in order to measure its success. Monitoring and public reporting mechanisms will be implemented and privately controlled systems will be created to reduce waste in the industry. Furthermore, food waste is responsible for the release of 3.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases into the planet's atmosphere each year; if food waste was a country, only China and the United States would possess a larger carbon footprint. Potential government action concerning waste is a significant driver behind the CGF's pledge. Last month, France announced legislation that would prohibit large supermarkets from destroying edible unsold food. Germany has been proactive in implementing internet-based systems to distribute 'refuse produce', which is in good condition, recovered from stores' rubbish. Meanwhile, Britain's largest supermarket chain, Tesco, has revealed plans to give away each day's unsold food to charity in ten of its stores.
