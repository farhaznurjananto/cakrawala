The Canadian Rangers, a group that is part of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve and is responsible for patrolling remote areas including the north, is set to receive replacement rifles. The current Lee-Enfield No. 4 model, which has been in use since World War II, is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain due to its age and lack of replacement parts. The new rifles will be customized versions of commercially available hunting rifles, able to protect Rangers from North American carnivores such as polar bears and wolves at ranges from 0 to 300 metres and remain operable in extreme temperatures. 

The new firearms will be known as the New Canadian Ranger Rifle (NCRR) system, which will replace the original Lee Enfield rifle fleet under the Munitions Supply Program (MSP). The rifle itself will be a bolt-action, magazine-fed rifle chambered in.308 Winchester. A hard and soft transport case, sling, cleaning kit, and trigger lock will also be provided as accessories. 

The new rifle prototypes have already been delivered to the Rangers for a trial that will last until the end of the year. Production of the 6,500 or more rifles will begin in mid-2016 and finish in 2018. The Canadian modifications include a larger bolt handle and enlarged trigger guard for accommodating gloved hands, protected front and rear iron sights, and an orange or red color with Ranger Crest. The rifle's two-stage trigger also has a three-position safety. 

Rangers will use the NCRR while patrolling remote coastal, central and northern Canadian areas, and the rifle will need to withstand high humidity and extreme temperatures ranging from -51°C to 39°C. The firearm is also required to be transportable using a variety of modes including foot, Ski-Doo, sled, small boats, and ATVs. Colt Canada will produce the barrel, bolt, and receiver under a license from Sako, a Finnish manufacturer, with Stoeger Canada from Ontario responsible for the supply of the rifles. 

In conclusion, the Canadian Rangers are finally getting their long-awaited replacement rifles, designed to withstand harsh conditions and protect them against local wildlife. It is hoped that the new rifles will provide more efficient performance compared to the aging Lee-Enfield rifles.
