National security experts have warned Congress about the escalating threat of information warfare attacks targeting the United States and have strongly encouraged the development of new strategies and organizations to combat these complex issues. These experts firmly believe that the US must adopt a more aggressive stance to effectively confront the problem, learning from past experiences and employing techniques that have previously been used against American interests.

Rand Waltzman, a specialist on information warfare with RAND Corp., argued that the focus of the US government and private sector on technical cybersecurity measures has proven inadequate in handling influence warfare. To address this growing concern, he called for the implementation of enhanced cognitive security measures. The 2011 attack carried out by the Russian government on US social media platforms serves as a vital reminder of the inadequacy and vulnerability of current security strategies. With information warfare now operating at speeds unimaginable in the past, a transformation in approach is urgently needed.

John C. Inglis, former deputy director of the National Security Agency, acknowledged that cyber-attacks constitute just one form of influence, propaganda, and disinformation currently being waged in the cyber war of ideas. Inglis advocated for a comprehensive new approach to information threats in order to more effectively combat these challenges, rather than simply reacting to each crisis as it arises. He emphasized the need for the United States to be proactive in anticipating and tracking threats in the cybersecurity domain.

Michael D. Lumpkin, a former State Department strategic messaging official, expressed concern over the US government's outdated and suppressed capacity to counter disinformation and promote effective alternative messaging. Stifled by bureaucracy, lack of accountability, and insufficient access to cutting-edge information, analytics tools, and highly skilled personnel, Lumpkin highlighted the increasingly sophisticated capabilities and investment of America's enemies in the information environment. These adversaries are no longer constrained by ethical considerations, legal boundaries, or even the truth, posing a significant challenge for the US to confront.

Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and specialist on information operations, identified Russia as the leading power in the realm of information operations. He outlined several factors that distinguish Russia from other influencers, such as their ability to create content across deliberate themes, hyper-empower political groups, coordinate unitary campaigns involving covert and overt accounts, and push their narrative deep into the target audience.

Watts emphasized that countering cyber influence threats is not merely a technical challenge but requires a human-focused approach. The involvement of real-world actors in enabling online operations is a crucial element that must be taken into consideration. Watts further highlighted the dire need for better knowledge of Russian information warfare and influence operations, as well as more accurate and effective communication from the American government. He also praised the efforts of Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia to block foreign information operations and encouraged Twitter to collaborate in this direction.

In response to these concerns, Waltzman proposed the development of a new strategy to enable cognitive security and confront the growing challenges in the information environment. Central to this proposition is the creation of a private research center, external to the government, which would focus on research and development for information operations in regards to policies, technologies, and techniques. Furthermore, a comprehensive government study should be conducted to assess existing laws and policies related to information warfare that may hinder effective operations, in addition to outlining an updated organizational structure for information operations.
