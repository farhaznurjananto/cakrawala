WASHINGTON (AP) — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is calling on President Donald Trump to remove environmental protections that ban commercial fishing in nearly a quarter of the world’s largest marine reserve.

Zinke sent a memo to Trump last month urging him to rescind an executive order that established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the northwest Hawaiian Islands in 2016. The monument is off-limits to commercial fishing and other activities, and was expanded by President Barack Obama to 582,578 square miles (1.5 million square kilometers).

The memo, obtained by The Associated Press, says the monument restriction “is essentially a freeze on economic activity” and should be undone. Zinke said commercial fishing could resume in the reserve with conditions, including a requirement that commercial fishing vessels report their catches to a database that tracks illegal fishing.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said commercial fishing would be allowed in the reserve without the monument designation.

Zinke’s memo was forwarded to Trump in mid-September and the president has 90 days to decide whether to rescind the monument.

The monument is home to seven species of endangered Hawaiian monk seals, 14 species of threatened or endangered sea turtles, and more than 250 species of seabirds.

Zinke has come under scrutiny for his travel and spending, including his use of charter flights and his treatment of staffers. In his memo, Zinke said he would not accept any more travel awards.
