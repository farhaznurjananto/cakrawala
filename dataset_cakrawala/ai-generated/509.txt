Today, ASUS announced the highly-anticipated roll-out of the Android Marshmallow 6.0 upgrade for its smartphone range. The Zenfone series, the company's top models which have been driving success, will be the first devices to receive the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update. Starting in March, nine major Zenfone series smartphones will get this update over the air (OTA). Last year, ASUS delighted its Zenfone customers with the Android Lollipop update for major devices, and this year, models ranging from the Zenfone Laser to the recently launched Zenfone Zoom are all receiving this Android M update.

The ASUS smartphone models set to receive the Android M (6.0) upgrade in March of 2016 include the ZenFone 2 (ZE550ML, ZE551ML), ZenFone 2 Deluxe (ZE551ML), ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE500KL, ZE550KL, ZE601KL), ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL), ZenFone Max (ZC550KL), and ZenFone Zoom (ZX551ML). Devices not mentioned in this list will start receiving the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update from April 2016 onwards. 

At the Zenfone Zoom launch event in January 2016, ASUS announced they have sold over 3 million Zenfone devices. The Android M update will bring improved performance and features to all these smartphone users.

Upon installing the Android M update on an ASUS smartphone, Google Messenger, Calendar, and Gmail apps will automatically be included. These apps will replace three ZenUI apps—ASUS Messenger, ASUS Mail and ASUS Calendar—as the default apps in the Android M version of ZenUI if the phone is restored to factory settings after the update. ASUS noted that if users restore to factory settings after updating, ASUS Messenger, ASUS Mail, and ASUS Calendar can be downloaded from Google Play.
