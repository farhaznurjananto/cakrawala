Once leading the charge to unveil the truth behind alleged Russian hacking, Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, now finds himself temporarily stepping away from his role amidst a whirlwind of controversy. The House Ethics Committee has turned its discerning gaze upon Nunes himself, probing claims that he may have spilled the beans on classified intelligenceâ€”accusations Nunes vehemently denies, branding them as mere political fabrications. 

While the investigation aims to shed light on possible entanglements between Trump's campaign and Moscow, Nunes isn't bowing out completely. He will forge on with his other responsibilities, and though he has temporarily passed the baton, Nunes has made it clear he plans to reclaim it at a later date. For now, however, the embattled Chairman must navigate the tempestuous waters of an ethics inquiry, all whilst seeking to clear his own name.
