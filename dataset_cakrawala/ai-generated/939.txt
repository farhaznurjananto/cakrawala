2015/05/26 The county of HABERSHAM A distressing revelation implicates a police chief and his supportive wife in the torturing and abuse of four children. Officer Richard Burton and his wife Cheryle have been charged with 28 counts of child abuse, and Officer Richard Burton has also been charged with child molestation. As a consequence of their guilty plea to four of the 28 counts of child maltreatment, the remaining accusations were dismissed as if nothing had occurred. Even the case of child molestation was withdrawn. The officer and his wife kept four defenseless children imprisoned in a room for years and provided them with inadequate nourishment. Surprisingly, they only received ten years of probation and will only serve 25 weekends in jail. The ages of the children currently range from 13 to 19. Nonetheless, they vividly recall what occurred and are attempting to heal. They were adopted by the officer and his wife at first. According to them, they endured years of neglect and violence. They were placed in a dark room with boarded-up windows, where they were subsequently beaten. "Being struck in the head with a wooden paddle, being tossed about the room, and thrown against the walls to the point where we had to stand upside down on the corner on our heads," one of the youngsters stated. "They would dump their unwanted leftovers into our pot of noodles, which we were required to consume. The food was cold from the refrigerator and not warm "he stated. In 2012, the savagery came to a stop when one of the youngsters fled and revealed what had transpired. The new foster parent of the children cannot believe that the Officer and his wife will only do 25 weekends in jail, a mere slap on the wrist. She stated, "I believe it's far too light." We believe that this is conveying the incorrect message. The Chief Deputy District Attorney acknowledged that Officer Burton's connections influenced the sentencing. "Our community's law enforcement officers were listed on the witness list for the defense," he stated. "Every day, we go into court and tell the jury that these individuals are believable."
