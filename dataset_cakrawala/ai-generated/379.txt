Have you ever been called big-boned? The idea of someone having larger, denser bones has often been thrown around as a compliment, but really, it could just be due to genetics. For some people, this means that they are heavier than their frame might suggest.

A recent study by researchers at Louisiana State University’s Pennington Biomedical Research Center has found that tall people tend to have disproportionately larger bones in comparison to shorter people. Tall individuals carry around more weight, thus the foundation of their body has to be larger to maintain strength, just like a tall building. "It’s the same thing with a building,” says Steven B. Heymsfield, MD. “When you build a tall building, you just can’t keep all the proportions the same. You have to build a larger foundation and an entirely different structure.”

While these findings may seem obvious, the study's use of DEXA ("dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry") scanning to measure body composition has brought scientific proof to support the idea of body structure. These scans use X rays to measure body fat, lean tissue, and bone mass, and have been featured on The Biggest Loser. They have become more convenient and affordable in recent years, enabling scientists to gather and analyze data in ways they never could before.

The size of your frame – the width of your shoulders, the circumference of your wrist – is mostly genetic. However, lifestyle factors can also influence bone thickness and density. People who gain a lot of muscle or body fat tend to develop stronger bones. Our bones become stronger by increasing the width of their outer protective layer, the cortex, which also makes the bone heavier.

As Dr. Heymsfield has explained, “Some people really do have heavier bones." Another expert in the field, Steven Gausewitz, MD, Chief of Staff at Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California, has said that there is also a big difference in bone size from one person to another. Gausewitz has stated that when he carries out surgeries on the skeleton, there is a variation of sizes of prosthetics that are required because while some people have wide bones, others have small skinny bones that aren't proportional to their size.

In sum, while it's possible to have larger, denser bone structure due to genetics, there are some factors that can influence bone thickness and density. As we continue to learn more about body composition and advances in body-scanning technology continue to emerge, it is likely that we will discover additional insights into the ways in which our bodies are uniquely structured.
