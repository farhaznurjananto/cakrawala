The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has reported a significant increase in the number of applications for driver's licenses from undocumented immigrants, substantially surpassing their initial projections. Since the initiation of the AB 60 program in January 2015, nearly half a million individuals have applied for a license. Consequently, approximately 203,000 have successfully obtained one.

Initially, the DMV had anticipated reaching the half-million application milestone by July 2015. However, due to the overwhelming demand, the agency was forced to extend its operations to accommodate the increased workflow. To address this issue, the DMV introduced four additional locations within San Diego County, rendering them operational on Saturdays.

California is one of ten states currently offering driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. It is important to note that these licenses include a distinctive marking, differentiating them from regular licenses and clearly indicating that they are not valid for federal identification purposes. Prior to the implementation of the AB 60 program, estimations projected that approximately 1.4 million individuals would apply for these licenses over a three-year period.

Advocates of the AB 60 program argue that it plays a vital role in facilitating the integration of immigrants into society, particularly those who rely on driving for their daily activities such as work or transporting their children to school. Conversely, critics have expressed concern regarding the state's ability to accurately verify the identities of foreign applicants, citing potential security risks.
