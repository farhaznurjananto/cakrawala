Paul Trad climber Muir Beach, CA Apr 22, 2013 - 11:55am PT Ed, thanks for being here. I can't believe I didn't catch this earlier. 
I remember readying your piece in the '80s and just loving it! I still have it somewhere. 
Nate, thanks for posting this. I just checked amazon and the book is available for a few bucks. I'm ordering it tonight. 
Thanks for the info about the long version of the story. I'll be interested to see how that fits into your novel. Josh Kornish 
climber Apr 22, 2013 - 12:29pm PT I just read the thread on the FA of the East Buttress of Mt. Whitney and it was mentioned that after the FA of the route Ed got a call from a friend who said that there was a party on the East Buttress and one member was suffering from HAPE. Ed phoned Joe Kelsey who was in the Sierra at the time, and Joe, Ed and another friend went to the base of the buttress and helped the team, who all got down safely. Does anyone have any further details, including who was on the team? Did they have a rope? I'm really interested in this story. 
thanks,

Josh Kornish

I believe the team was Joe Kelsey, Don Whillans, and Ed Viesturs, with a single 60m rope. HAPE is High Altitude Pulmonary Edema. I don't know if they had a rope. I don't know what the outcome was. Sorry. 
Cheers,
