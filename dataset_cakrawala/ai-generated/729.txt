Parents Hannah and Chris hurried to the infant's cot in response to the three-month-cries. old's Thankfully, Chris, 30, had received training in infant resuscitation. He had to find out before the twins could return home from the hospital since they were 15 weeks early. Jake was all floppy, and his lips were bluish, the man remarked. Fortunately, he came back after one breath and one press on his chest. It's unsettling to consider that we were only roused from sleep by his sister's sobs. It would have been too late if she hadn't been crying. Jake stopped breathing once more after being sent to Dr. Gray's Hospital in Elgin. He was put on a ventilator and taken to Edinburgh Royal Hospital, where doctors discovered he had three infections and that one of his lungs had collapsed. "That was very scary," said Hannah, 24, a mother of Dylan, 6, Sophie, 3, and Ethan, 1. We genuinely believed we might lose our young son. He would not have survived if Amie's tears hadn't been shed at that precise moment. The twins' medical ordeal was not their first. When Hannah went into labor at just 25 weeks into her pregnancy, it took medical professionals 12 minutes and seven attempts to revive 1lb 11oz Amie. Jake, who weighed 1 lb 13 oz, arrived an hour later. When I first saw them, Hannah, of Buckie, Banffshire, commented, "They were so small. Their skin had the appearance of cling film, allowing you to see within them. I merely wondered, "Will they survive? " You couldn't talk to them or touch them because of how preterm they were since it may send them into shock. "I couldn't cuddle them, and it was one of the worst things."

It was a big relief for the family to have the twins home after their three-month battle for life in an Edinburgh hospital required blood transfusions, lumbar punctures, and oxygen therapy. Amie returned one week after Jake, still need oxygen. As soon as they were together, Hannah remarked, "They were holding hands." The twins are now content and healthy nine months after Amie saved their little lives. While they are still only around the size of a three-month-old, Amie was taken off oxygen two weeks ago, and doctors are pleased with their development. The twins' first birthdays will be this summer, and the family is anticipating it. When she reflected, Hannah remarked, "How did we manage?" Well, we just did. Being with my entire family makes me feel so fortunate. Jake and Amie are truly small wonders. Take our daily news quiz to see how you do.
