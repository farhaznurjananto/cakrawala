Nick Acosta, a Doctor Who fan and content creator, decided to embark on an experiment. His idea was to take classic Doctor Who episodes from the 60s and 70s and give them a modern musical score. The result was a strange yet captivating mix that combined the best of both worlds. 

Acosta chose one of his favorite episodes, "Doctor Who and the Sea Devils" from 1972, and re-edited and rescored it. To score the episode, he used composer Murray Gold's beautiful arrangements, which have become synonymous with the modern Doctor Who series. The episode was reduced down to a compelling 7-minute action sequence that showcased everything that made the classic show great, including the Doctor's battle against the Master. 

Acosta's work was received with enthusiasm and admiration by fans of the show on Reddit. According to the fans, the remixed episodes were a great way to relive classic episodes with a modern twist. They appreciated the creativity and innovation that Acosta demonstrated by remixing the episodes. 

In his own words, Acosta explained his inspiration for the project. He said, "Watching 'classic' episodes from the 60's and 70's makes me wish they had the beautiful musical score that its modern-day incarnation has." He acknowledged that the music played a significant role in making the series excellent and felt that the classic episodes would benefit from a modern score. 

Throughout the episode, keen observers may note that Acosta lifted some scenes from another episode, "Terror of the Autons." He even included the first and last scenes from the episode as bookends to the mini-episode he created. The scenes he chose seemed too perfect not to include and added to the overall appeal of the episode. 

Acosta's work is a testament to the power of experimentation and illustrates how creative and innovative content creators can add value to popular shows like Doctor Who. His experiment gave fans an opportunity to experience classic episodes of the beloved show from a fresh perspective. If anything, Acosta's work has demonstrated that even a small tweak, like adding a new musical score, can make a significant difference in the way fans experience a show. 

Overall, Acosta's experiment has been received with enthusiasm and admiration by fans of Doctor Who, and they are eagerly waiting for more remixed episodes. With his work, Acosta has elevated the discussions around the show and has illustrated what is possible when content creators are courageous and bold in their approach.
