New opinion polls show a sharp drop in approval ratings for President Obama's  Middle East policies. 
 According to polls conducted by the Arab American Institute in six Middle Eastern countries, President Obama's approval rating is below 10%, reflecting a negative attitude toward US policy in the region.

 According to the survey, 88% of Moroccans believe the president has failed to live up to the expectations set out in his 2009 "Cairo Speech", while 90% of Egyptians say they are unhappy with his policies. Disappointment was highest in Lebanon, where 99% opposed Obama's policies, and in Saudi Arabia, where 77% were disappointed. 
 The poll also shows that both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and US interference in the region are seen as the biggest obstacle to peace and stability. Many also noted that the America's role in establishing a no-fly zone over Libya, and the killing of Osama bin Laden as the other major factors contributing to their disapproval. 
  According to AAI President, Dr. James Zogby, President Obama did not create the problems, but rather created the expectations that the problems will be solved. Zogby said that when confronted with the possibility of low approval ratings, the administration "was not surprised".
