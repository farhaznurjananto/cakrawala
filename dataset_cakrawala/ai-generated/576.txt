Sharon Wood, the mother of two children who tragically died from carbon monoxide poisoning while on holiday in 2006, confronted the former CEO of Thomas Cook, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, over his decision not to answer questions during their inquests. The incident occurred when Robert and Christianne Shepherd were vacationing with their father and step-mother at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in Corfu, Greece, which they had booked through the Thomas Cook travel agency.

The hearing in Wakefield witnessed Mr. Fontenla-Novoa exercising his legal right not to answer any questions that might incriminate him. Feeling frustrated by this, the children's mother, Sharon Wood, urged the former CEO to "speak up for himself."

Previously, the inquest had heard how a faulty hot water boiler, located in an external outhouse and containing various defects, served as the source of the lethal carbon monoxide that caused the tragedy. During the hearing, Leslie Thomas QC, the barrister representing the children's family, questioned Mr. Fontenla-Novoa about the statements he made to the police in 2009. In response, the former CEO declined to answer each time, invoking his legal right not to incriminate himself.

The children's barrister then made a bold allegation against Thomas Cook, asserting that the company had prioritized profit over safety. The former CEO responded by saying, "I deeply regret the incident that occurred." Following this, Sharon Wood continued to press Mr. Fontenla-Novoa to "speak up for himself," but he nevertheless maintained his stance of declining to answer further questions.

The barrister also inquired about Thomas Cook's health and safety systems in place at the time and why they failed to prevent the tragedy. However, Mr. Fontenla-Novoa still refused to provide any answers, leaving the bereaved family without closure.

During the hearing, Leslie Thomas QC attempted to have the former CEO commit to cooperating with the investigation by asking, "Your staff have all sat there and declined to answer. Are you going to lead by example and cooperate?" Nevertheless, Mr. Fontenla-Novoa continued to refuse to answer any questions.

The barrister then proceeded to ask the former CEO a series of specific questions on behalf of the family, but Mr. Fontenla-Novoa declined to answer them as well. Despite the family's continued efforts to seek justice and answers, the former CEO remained uncooperative.

The tragic incident continues to have a lasting impact on the family and raises questions about the responsibilities and accountability of travel agencies in ensuring the safety of their customers. With the hearing still ongoing, the family hopes to eventually gain the answers and closure they desperately seek.
