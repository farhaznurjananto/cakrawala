Real Madrid is set for a challenging match against Real Sociedad, as they will have to depend on their reserves due to the absence of Ronaldo, Marcelo, Kroos, and Benzema. Although the recent return of Marco Asensio offers hope, Madrid must secure the three points needed to avoid their third consecutive draw in games against Valencia and Levante. 

Squad members for Real Madrid include Goalkeepers Keylor Navas, Casilla, and Luca; Defenders Carvajal, Nacho, Theo, Ramos, Varane, and Achraf; Midfielders Casemiro, Isco, Ceballos, Modric, Llorente, Asensio, and Franchu; and Attackers Bale, Lucas VÃ¡zquez, and Mayoral.

Zidane is anticipated to start Isco in midfield, supported by Vazquez, Asensio, and Bale upfront. If he decides to maintain the 4-3-1-2 formation that has led to recent successes, Dani Ceballos may also appear in the starting lineup. A crucial factor in the game will be Madrid's ability to control the tempo, with Ceballos as the potential player to achieve this if he can maintain composure.

The match will take place on 17th September 2017 at the Anoeta in San Sebastian, Spain, with coverage available on BeIN Sports (USA), Sky Sports Football (UK), and Canal+ Partidazo (Spain). Streaming will be accessible on BeIN Sports (USA) and Fubo.TV.

The game's prediction stands at Real Sociedad 1 (William Jose) - 2 Real Madrid (Isco, Asensio).
