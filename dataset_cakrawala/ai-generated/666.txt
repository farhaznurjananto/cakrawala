In a recent ComRes poll conducted for the Bible Society, it was observed that although nearly half (46%) of the Britons surveyed regard the Bible as a significant book, a considerable number of them are unaware of the origins of the modern-day phrases contained within its text. Instead, they often mistakenly attribute these phrases to sources such as The Beatles, William Shakespeare, or even Tony Blair.

Out of the 2,379 respondents, a mere 7% acknowledged that the phrase "a drop in the bucket" was derived from the Book of Isaiah. Surprisingly, more popular attributions for the phrase included Tony Blair (12%), William Shakespeare (14%), and Charles Dickens (12%). These results coincide with the unveiling of "The People's Bible," a collaborative project between the Bible Society in England and Wales and The Scottish Bible Society. This innovative, handwritten, digital Bible will be showcased in various towns and cities across the UK, inviting the public to engage with the Bible afresh, either as an introduction or to reacquaint themselves with its content.

Notably, the poll indicated that among individuals working in the arts, approximately twice as many considered the Bible significant in comparison to professionals in the fields of classical music and politics. Commenting on these findings, Luke Walton, Culture Programme Manager at the Bible Society, highlighted the limited understanding many people have about the Bible's pervasive influence on society. Walton expressed hope that the project would prompt individuals to recognize the impact of the Bible in various aspects of life, including culture, history, politics, and personal development. Emphasizing the enduring relevance of the world's best-selling book, Walton asserted that the Bible should maintain a prominent presence in public discourse.
