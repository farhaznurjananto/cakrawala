Starting this week, MoreMOBA starts streaming Paragon every Thursday. To celebrate, we want to add more Paragon content for those switching to Paragon from other MOBAs. Today we'll be looking at a general overview of Paragon's heroes and which heroes/champions/gods from other MOBAs they can best compare to. Sometimes there are obvious comparisons between the two characters, but other times there are no direct counterparts in other MOBAs, so I'll give you a brief explanation explaining how the two characters match in terms of design. 
  If you've ever wondered, "I'm new to Paragon, which character should I try first?", this article will help. If you like heroes/champions/gods with names in bold, I highly recommend the named Paragon Heroes. If you like the playstyle of the heroes/champions/gods whose names are in italics, then they might like the Paragon heroes listed below. Heroes/champions/gods whose names appear in  italics may have similar  abilities, playstyles, or psychological appeal to the same player, which will be explained in the description.
