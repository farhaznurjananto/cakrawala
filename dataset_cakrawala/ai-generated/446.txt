The NFL free agency is all about value. Teams try to identify players who will produce more value than their contractual demands suggest. It means finding players who are better than everybody else realizes. This is why successful organizations take advantage of the opportunity provided by free agency to acquire potential stars. Good general managers find players that fit their team's holes before signing them at a market price below their true value.

On the other hand, the job of an agent is diametrically opposed to that of a general manager. Agents' main job is to make the players they represent look as valuable as possible. They create the best possible context for their player and create demand. They convince the general managers that the player they're trying to sign is worth more than their valuation.

As part of the NFL's free agency preview, we will approach the market from an agent's perspective. These agents prepare similar sorts of packets for their players. Similarly, we will prepare abbreviated "books" for five of the NFL's most interesting restricted and unrestricted free agents.

Today, we start with explosive Steelers wideout Mike Wallace. Here, we go in-depth into why Wallace deserves to be considered the most promising young receiver in all of football.

Wallace has accomplished more than any other young wide receiver in recent memory, despite unfavorable conditions, regular absences from his starting quarterback, and the presence of two of the league's most decorated wide receivers ahead of him. During Wallace's first three years in the league, he's gained 3,206 receiving yards, which is the second-most accrued during a player's first three seasons, behind only Anquan Boldin.

Wallace's performance during his first three seasons compares favorably to stars like Calvin Johnson, Andre Johnson, and Roddy White over the first three years in their respective careers. He's scored 24 touchdowns in his first three seasons, more than any other receiver in football besides Braylon Edwards.

However, there are reasons to think that Wallace's statistics might understate his true level of performance. While Wallace has made it through every contest in his 48-game career without missing a game, his quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has missed several due to injury. Together, those injuries mean that Wallace has had to play just under 17 percent of his career with a backup quarterback under center.

Furthermore, during Wallace's tenure with the Steelers, he's been part of a team that's played at a very slow pace. In fact, Pittsburgh's offense only ran 165 possessions last year, the lowest total in football. Fewer possessions mean fewer chances to rack up totals.

In conclusion, if we prorate each set of numbers to a 16-game season, Wallace has been about twice as good with Roethlisberger in the lineup as he has been without. Therefore, there is a possibility that Wallace could be even more effective in a different team with better conditions.
