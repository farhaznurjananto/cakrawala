Adoption and foster care are often cited as an alternative to abortion by those who seek to deprive women of their reproductive rights. However, offering adoption as the universal solution to unwanted pregnancies is not only misguided, but it also harms everyone involved.

Some anti-choice advocates often present adoption as a more ethical option for dealing with unwanted pregnancies than abortion. In a 2012 column for the New York Times, well-known anti-choice columnist Ross Douthat bemoaned the fact that fewer babies are available for infertile couples to adopt thanks to Roe v. Wade. Similarly, in 2013, Texas state Sen. Eddie Lucio proposed subjecting women to three hours of adoption education before allowing them to obtain abortions.

While adoption may be a valid option for some women, especially those who choose it voluntarily, it may not be the wisest choice for many. My experience as the co-director of an adoption agency has shown that asking women to place their child for adoption comes with a heavy heart and immense sadness for those who are left with no other options. Posing adoption as the universal solution to unwanted pregnancies does a disservice to everyone involved.

For 27 years, my professional life consisted of talking to women who were considering placing children for adoption; evaluating prospective adoptive parents; helping to facilitate relationships between all parties involved and following up after placement. I was involved in some capacity with approximately 80 voluntary adoptions annually. As such, I feel compelled to offer a viewpoint sometimes overlooked by leaders in the reproductive rights debate — that of someone intimately familiar with the emotional issues surrounding adoption.

Most women who end up in an adoption agency are too late for an abortion, didn't know where to get one, or didn't have the money to cover the expenses of an abortion. They just knew that they couldn’t parent a child — and, without the ability to access an abortion, adoption was their last resort.

Although it may seem like adoption is a straightforward solution, it's not. The decision to place a child for adoption is not an easy choice. Women experience an enormous amount of sadness and guilt, having exhausted every other path. Many have no one they can turn to for help, and the social services available to them are so paltry that raising a child seems impossible.

What's more, adoption still accounts for a rare choice among pregnant women. Recent statistics show that approximately 14,000 newborns are adopted annually in the United States through voluntary placements, a number that has remained flat for about 20 years. Meanwhile, in 2011, 1.06 million abortions were performed—the lowest number in decades. Even with the societal and legal stigma surrounding abortion combined with adoption's relative accessibility, the vast majority of pregnant women who choose to seek out an abortion feel it is the right decision.

Women who opt for adoption frequently experience many more difficulties than they bargained for. For some mothers, having to undergo nine months of pregnancy and making inquiries about future plans for the baby can be emotionally devastating. Others may choose to go with adoptive parents who are strangers, which can also add to their stress. After adoption, these women have to trust their child's adoptive parents to follow through on post-placement contact agreements.

The growing popularity of open adoption, through which birth parents can have contact with their child and the adoptive family, is not a panacea for these problems, though it is certainly an improvement over the secretive closed system common in past decades. The relationship between adoptive parents, adopted children, and birth parents involves everyone having the best intentions, sophisticated psychological understanding, and an enormous amount of compassion and respect for everyone involved. Although birth mothers frequently assume that an open plan will guarantee a long-term positive connection among all parties, agencies and attorneys, who seem to tout “openness” as a catch-all, must recognize that these relationships will always be somewhat unpredictable and emotionally fraught, as all human interactions are.

Furthermore, people who believe that adoption or foster care is a natural solution to growing restrictions on reproductive rights are not only misguided but also kidding themselves. Currently, there are close to 400,000 children in state custody, and only half have permanent plans for placement. Employees in protective services are underpaid and overworked, treading water to try to ensure that all of the children in their care are happy and healthy.

Politicians, pundits, and anti-choice advocates should not present adoption as superior to abortion by overlaying it with talk about selflessness, wonderful adoptive parents, openness, and future contact as a way to ameliorate loss. Women deserve the truth and access to all options.

In conclusion, although adoption and foster care are valid options, they are not the solution to the growing restrictions on reproductive rights. Everyone should have access to comprehensive reproductive health care, including access to safe and legal abortion. Instead of demonizing abortion or idealizing adoption, all options must be presented truthfully. Only then can women make informed decisions based on their personal beliefs, medical needs, and circumstances.
