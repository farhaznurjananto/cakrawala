A A NORTH BEND, Wash. -- In a move that was as surprising as it was anticipated, the Seahawks re-signed former Pro Bowl receiver Bobby Engram to a one-year deal on Tuesday. 
The Seahawks had released Engram on Feb. 28, making him a free agent. But he was a free agent for only a day, returning to the Seahawks at a reduced rate of $1 million for next season. 
Engram, who turns 36 in September, caught 94 passes for 1,147 yards and six touchdowns last season. It was the second-best performance of his career, behind only his 96 catches for 1,167 yards in 2007. 
"Bobby's a proven professional who has given everything he has for this team," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said in a statement. "He knows our offense, he knows our players, and he is a trusted voice in the locker room. He's played at a high level for a long time, and we're excited to have him back." 
Engram has caught 474 passes for 5,834 yards and 32 touchdowns in his career. That includes nine seasons with the Chicago Bears, who drafted him in the second round in 1996. He also played for the New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs. 
Engram's return gives the Seahawks a veteran presence at receiver behind starters Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett and Jermaine Kearse. He can also play on the outside. 
"Bobby is a versatile player who can do a lot of different things for us," Carroll said. "He has a lot of experience and can help us in a lot of ways." 
The Seahawks also released defensive back DeShawn Shead and waived offensive lineman Germain Ifedi.
