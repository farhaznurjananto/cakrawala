Every once in a while, a show comes along that is so comically terrible, it is almost enjoyable - almost. Such is the case with "The Anthem," a highly flawed musical loosely based on Ayn Rand's 1938 sci-fi novella of the same name. Starring Randy Jones (the original cowboy from Village People), the production resembles an awkward combination of "Starlight Express" and a ludicrous circus performance.

Set in a dystopian future reminiscent of a 1980s music video, the plot follows the political awakening of the handsome Prometheus (Jason Gotay) as he defies a society that condemns independent thought. This message is awkwardly expressed by Jones' exaggerated portrayal of the villainous Tiberius, who delivers Randian lines with a comical lack of nuance.

Despite the material's potential for parody, director Rachel Klein and her creative team - including book writer Gary Morgenstein, composer Jonnie Rockwell, and lyricist Erik Ransom - seem to take the story somewhat seriously, even though the show is laden with unintentionally humorous moments.

Indeed, laughter often arises from scenes that aren't meant to be funny. In one such instance, a muscly executioner in leather shorts (Jamyl Dobson) passionately sings "The Palace of Mating" to a suggestive guitar riff in the background. Another unintentionally comical moment occurs when Prometheus and the fiery rebel Athena (Ashley Kate Adams) sing a duet filled with absurd lyrics.

These and other similarly ridiculous elements stretch the show to nearly 2.5 hours, a shockingly long duration for a 128-page book adaptation. It is our hope that the creative team behind "The Anthem" does not attempt to tackle "Atlas Shrugged" next.
