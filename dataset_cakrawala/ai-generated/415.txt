Two lawsuits were dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday, involving the US government documents about Barack Obama's administration. The documents were linked with his administration’s claim of legal authority to order the killing of suspected American terrorist members overseas. US District Judge Colleen McMahon expressed frustration with regard to the state of the law, stating in a 75-page opinion that she faced a “veritable Catch-22” in deciding whether or not the government could block public disclosure of legal memos justifying the president’s overseas kill operations.
 
The judge referred to whether the administration would be ordered under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to disclose to the public certain legal memos written by government lawyers justifying the targeted killing of US citizens who were living overseas who were suspected of involvement in terror operations. “This Court is constrained by law, and under the law, I can only conclude that the Government has not violated FOIA by refusing to turn over the documents sought in the FOIA requests,” McMahon said. She added that the government could not be “compelled by this court of law to explain in detail the reasons why its actions do not violate the Constitution and laws of the United States”.
 
The lawsuits were filed in New York City’s federal court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union and two reporters with The New York Times. One copy of a memorandum was requested by both parties: this document was prepared by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The same office during the Bush administration that prepared a series of memos that offered legal justifications for harsh interrogation tactics, which were heavily criticised.
 
In 2011, US drone strikes in Yemen killed three US citizens, including a sixteen-year-old young man named Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, whose father, an Al Qaeda operative, was also killed. All controversial and classified documents are allowed to be withheld by the US government under exemptions to freedom of information laws. However, an unclassified memorandum generated by the Department of Defense has yet to undergo further judgement.
 
The lawsuit was denied allowing the possibility for public access to critical resource materials. The executive branch of government is allowed to proclaim that certain actions are lawful without revealing their specific reasons, according to the judge.
 
“This ruling denies the public access to crucial information about the government’s extrajudicial killing of US citizens,” said ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jameel Jaffer, after the lawsuits were dismissed.
