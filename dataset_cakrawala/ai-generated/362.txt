Kelvin Gastelum, the 25-year old rising star of the UFC, has been causing quite a stir in MMA circles due to his latest announcement that he intends to go back and forth between the welterweight and middleweight divisions. Gastelum has always been seen as someone with enormous potential, and whilst his career thus far has had its ups and downs- with some weight issues and injuries generating some controversy- he is now emerging as one of the most talked about fighters in the UFC.
 
Gastelum has long held the belief that the 170-pound weight class was ideal for him, although he has been temporarily moved up to 185 pounds twice now. Despite finding immediate success fighting at middleweight, Gastelum is still keen to return to welterweight at some point in his career, and has even declared that he wants to compete in both weight classes.
 
When asked about his ability to compete in both divisions, Gastelum said this: “I don’t see why I can’t be competing in both weight classes… I’m pretty confident in my abilities, confident in my skills to know that I can compete with the best middleweights and also the best welterweights.”
 
Gastelum is currently preparing for his next bout against UFC veteran Vitor Belfort in Brazil in the middleweight division, though only recently expressed his interest in going down to 170-pound class;   should he find a compelling enough offer to convince him to take it, however, he is willing to continue his success at middleweight as well.
 
Fighting in two weight classes will undoubtedly be a challenge, but Gastelum isn’t concerned about hindering his title hopes by doing so. In fact, he believes fighting in both divisions will help hone his skills and ultimately bring him closer to the UFC championships. “I think it’ll open up my horizons even more… Whatever fight gets me to the title fight faster is the fight that I’ll take.”
 
In order to make the consistent weight dictated by fighting in two different classes, Gastelum will continue to work with top nutritionist George Lockhart. Lockhart will mainly help prevent Gastelum from gaining a significant amount of weight when he’s not in fight camp, which has happened before. Gastelum explained that he often gains around 40-50 pounds above his fighting weight when he’s not in training, which has led to some issues with weight prior to fights.
 
In summary, Gastelum’s ambition is clear; he aims to be one of the few fighters who have succeeded in fighting at a high level in two weight classes. If he can achieve this, we could see him rise to the very top of the UFC in the coming years.
