I came across an interview with Khizr Khan from last year. He mentioned his son Humayun and criticized Trump in a manner similar to his recent remarks. "Muslims are American, Muslims are citizens, Muslims participat[e] in the well-being of this country as American citizens," Khan's father, Khizr Khan, who moved to the U.S. in the late 1970s after growing up in Pakistan, said Tuesday. "We are patriotic Americans. We came here because of the values of this country, not because of our religion. Trump's stance on these issues does not reflect those values "He stated. Surprisingly, he also said this about terrorism: "This is the time for American Muslims to expose any traitor among us. It is past time for Muslims to take a firm stand [against terrorists] "The elder Khan related his story. "Among us are the enemies of this country's value system. And we must defend it. And if that means exposing the traitors hiding behind an American passport, so be it." Of course, he is not alone among American Muslims who feel this way, even if Trump denies it. However, Khan's background should make it even more difficult for Republicans who want to ignore Khan or support Trump to do so. Khan's speech astounded me, and what has happened since has astounded me even more. Many thanks to him and his wife for their bravery in doing something that is clearly not fun for them. Also, for getting high. Vocativ This is what the father of a Muslim war hero has to say to Donald Trump.
