The rapid pace of technological and societal change has been a defining characteristic of the 21st century. In fact, the foretelling of an impending "future shock" was predicted in Alvin Toffler's bestseller, Future Shock, published back in 1970. Six million copies were sold and the public was warned about the dangers of change. However, nearly half a century later, it seems that everyone is ready and embracing the constantly evolving world.

The world has changed in ways that Toffler never predicted, which has led to some questioning whether he and others were wrong about the consequences of this rapid transformation. Evolution, cosmology, and global warming, for example, have been relegated to the background noise of our daily lives while celebrity gossip and consumerism takes center stage.

Perhaps what we need is something that will really shake things up and make us take notice. It might be receiving HD video from outer space or the creation of AI singularities. It might be the depletion of vital resources, such as oil, gas, and other raw materials. Or it might be the dramatic effects of rising sea levels and climate change. These events are tangible and impossible to ignore.

But would this be enough to change society? History suggests that most people will focus on their personal needs and desires. They rarely change their core behavior or personality, no matter how significant the changes in their surroundings may be.

However, if something truly extraordinary occurs, if we ever find ourselves encountering beings that are smarter than us, it is likely that our world would be completely transformed. Whether it comes in the form of aliens from other worlds or artificial superintelligence, meeting beings that are significantly smarter than us would be a turning point. The ramifications of such an encounter are nigh on impossible to predict, but it's likely that such a development would change our species forever.

In conclusion, the pace of change in the world is extraordinary, but humanity seems to be adapting to it rather well. However, the consequences of encountering alien beings or creating sentient AI cannot be underestimated. These developments would undoubtedly change society and humanity in ways that are difficult to imagine.
