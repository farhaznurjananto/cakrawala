On Wednesday morning, a 21-year-old transgender woman, Deshawnda Sanchez, was shot and killed while begging for help at the front door of a South L.A. home. According to the officers who arrived at the scene around 4 a.m., they found the victim suffering from a gunshot wound on the front porch of the residence. The paramedics who arrived later, pronounced her dead at the scene.

The police responded to a 911 call reporting a robbery in progress - however, the investigators believe the shooting could be a hate crime but have not confirmed it yet. This year, Deshawnda Sanchez is the third transgender woman to be killed in Los Angeles. The police have not identified any suspect, except for one of the three incidents.

Christopher Barling, LAPD Detective, did not rule out the possibility of the shooting being a hate crime. However, it has not been confirmed yet. Members of the LGBT community have previously claimed that transgender women, particularly women of color, are disproportionately affected by violent assaults, thereby highlighting the need for more protection of the community.

Christopher Argyros, manager of the anti-violence project at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, stresses that the community should value the lives of transgender women. In the three transgender women murder cases this year, the LGBT community has expressed their concerns, stating that the statistics on such crimes are evident that the victims' lives are not being valued enough.

According to the hate-crime statistics report released by the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations in October, the number of reported hate crimes against transgender people in Los Angeles jumped by nearly 46% last year. This reflects the seriousness of hate crimes against the transgender community in Los Angeles.

Zoraida “Ale” Reyes, 28-year-old, was found dead in the parking lot of a Dairy Queen in Anaheim, while Aniya Knee Parker, 47, was fatally shot in the middle of Melrose Ave in Hollywood. The police filed a felony charge against Randy Lee Parkerson of Anaheim for Reyes’ murder, while the other two cases are unresolved.

The third murder case this year has prompted members of the transgender community to call for justice for Deshawnda Sanchez to demand an end to violence against transgender people in Los Angeles. On Friday evening, the Trans community organized a candlelight vigil near the site of the shooting to commemorate her memory and advocate for an end to violence against their community. The community hopes that publicizing these crimes will generate awareness and create a safer environment for the transgender community.
