Setting a powerful example for political hopefuls around the country, an impressive 35 candidates for the Massachusetts state legislature have taken the Clean Money for Climate Pledge to refuse contributions from executives, lobbyists, and others employed by 10 major fossil fuel and utility companies in the 2016 election cycle. 

The pledge, launched by 350 Mass Action, requires candidates to turn down donations of $200 or more from ten polluting corporations including BP, Chevron, Eversource, ExxonMobil, Global Partners, Global Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, National Grid, Shell, and Spectra Energy. Each of these companies has a history of making significant campaign contributions in Massachusetts and of pushing for policies that prioritize their own interests over those of the public.

MassLive reports that employees of the companies listed, particularly National Grid, Eversource, Global Partners and Global Petroleum, have donated thousands of dollars to numerous legislators, who then supported bills largely favoring the utility industry. The pledge also targets four of the 90 companies and government-run industries responsible for two-thirds of the world's carbon emissions, according to 350 Mass Action. 

"All of these companies continue to advocate against a transition to renewable energy," said 350 Mass Action executive director Craig Altemose. "In the face of the climate crisis, Massachusetts needs lawmakers who are free to stand up to fossil fuel companies and utilities and lead us safely to a future powered by 100 percent clean, renewable energy."

The pledge has been embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike, including incumbent legislators and challengers. State Senate Democrats from Senate Majority Leader Marc Pacheco to challenger Andrea Harrington all took the pledge, along with the one Republican, Christine Canning, running for an open seat in the western part of the state. The same is true for the State House, where five incumbent Democrats and at least six Democrats vying for an open seat have signed on, as well as two of the candidates running write-in campaigns.

The impressive show of dedication to protecting the environment and creating effective policy by these 35 candidates not only sets an important example for politicians throughout the country, but also proves that the people of Massachusetts are serious about standing up to corporate interests and safeguarding a future powered by renewable energy.
