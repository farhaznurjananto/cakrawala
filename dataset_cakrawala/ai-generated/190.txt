Warning: You may find this video disturbing. It is footage of a man being shot to death in the street, taken from a camera mounted on the police officer’s gun.

The video above is from a police body camera and it is graphic. It shows the final moments of Daniel Shaver’s life. In 2016, an Arizona police officer shot and killed Shaver, an unarmed man, in a hotel hallway.

Shaver, a 26-year-old father of two, was on his hands and knees, begging for his life when he was shot. The officer who shot him, Philip Brailsford, was acquitted of second-degree murder.

The shooting sparked outrage and led to calls for police reform. Shaver’s family has filed a $100 million lawsuit against the city of Mesa, Brailsford, and the officer’s employer, the Mesa Police Department.
