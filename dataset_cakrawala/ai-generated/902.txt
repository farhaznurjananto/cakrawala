A top Department of Veterans Affairs official said Wednesday that his agency may never explain how a $604 million Aurora hospital project ballooned to $1.73 billion in two years. Democratic Senators. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have requested a full price rise account, arguing those statistics must exist. VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson stated at a construction site news conference that the $1.1 billion disparity would not be itemized. "There's no dollar-by-dollar account," he continued. Gibson said the December 2014 Civilian Board of Contract Appeals court judgment that upheld Kiewit-VA Turner's complaint best explains the cost overruns. That verdict found many VA errors but did not assess their costs. Gibson said Aurora's cost surge was due to the VA's new Integrated Design and Build contract and the November 2011 handwritten agreement to start construction. Gibson claimed SA-007 "placed the obligation of cost on the VA" for an economical design. "VA and Kiewit-Turner fought from then on." Gibson met with Kiewit-Turner and VA project executives before addressing to reporters. On his eighth journey to Colorado, he found a warm day with predicted sunshine. "Complete this project. No doubt, "said. Gibson said everyone was honest. "We address difficulties," he stated. By eliminating a nursing home and PTSD unit, the VA has cut project costs. Gibson said $625 million is required to finish the medical center, but Congress has funded work through September. PHOTOS: Tour the troubled Aurora VA Hospital. To fund the remaining work, the department offered a 0.89 percent across-the-board cut. That cut wouldn't affect veterans' benefits. The VA's Colorado hospital complex is the worst part of a controversial large development initiative. After Kiewit-Turner won the court fight in December, construction halted, resumed under an interim deal, then nearly halted again in May before Congress authorized another short-term infusion of money. Gibson doubted the hospital would open in 2017 as building continues with fewer workers. He defended his department's responsibility, noting that two senior executives departed despite inquiries from an agency-appointed investigative board and other top Aurora project leaders retired before the review. "None were removed," he added. During the news conference, the state branch of Concerned Veterans for America issued a statement disagreeing with that explanation. "Individuals directing such a terrible project should be held accountable, but instead they were allowed golden parachutes and pocketed millions of dollars in bonuses," said state director Frank Crocker. Gibson was asked if the VA's Aurora fiasco answer would satisfy congressional critics. "No, honestly," he said. "They want firings."
