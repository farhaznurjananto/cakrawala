Title: A Guide to Gluten-Free Bread in Tokyo (Dec 23, 2015)

Navigating the world of gluten-free eating can be a challenge, especially for individuals with celiac disease. This is particularly true when traveling to countries where gluten sensitivity is less prevalent, such as Asia, where celiac disease is primarily a Western genetic mutation. This article aims to provide guidance on how to find, prepare, and store gluten-free (rice) bread in Tokyo.

Product Information: Maisen, a Japanese brand, offers a variety of gluten-free and dairy-free rice bread options. Shoppers can easily identify these products by looking for the 'no wheat' and 'no milk' symbols prominently displayed on the front of the packaging.

Where to Buy: A small supermarket located on the 3rd floor of Akihabara Station offers gluten-free rice bread alongside other traditional bread varieties. This supermarket also boasts a wide selection of "international foods" primarily featuring American, German, Italian, and Hispanic cuisines. Additional gluten-free options available include peanut butter, jam, and gluten-free pasta (note that boiling is required).

Preparing the Bread: Maisen's gluten-free bread is sold unsliced. A small knife with a sheath can be purchased for ¥600 at Don Quijote (ドン・キホーテ), a popular multi-level superstore. Take note that slicing the bread may create some crumbs; to minimize mess, consider slicing the bread all at once and placing it back in its packaging.

Storage Tips: The bread's packaging does not include a resealable option. To keep the bread fresh, fold the open end of the packaging and wrap it tightly with a plastic shopping bag. Keep in mind that rice bread can dry out fairly quickly, which is a common characteristic of this gluten-free alternative to wheat bread.
