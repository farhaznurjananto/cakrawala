José Antonio Pérez Tapias (Sevilla, 1955) returns home for Christmas. Specifically, he does so with the Publisher of the University of Granada, the institution where he works as a professor and serves as the Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. The book is titled "The Unbearable Contradiction of a Cynical Democracy," a collection of texts—several of which were published here in CTXT—written between 2015 and 2016 in which Tapias analyzes and contextualizes the political situation of our country and the European Union during that time.

The crisis of democracy is the common denominator in this book, which delves into the deterioration of institutions and the growing disaffection of citizens toward their political leaders. Tapias does so from a left-leaning perspective, pointing directly at the party he himself is part of: the PSOE. Through the emergence of "new politics," the resurgence of right-wing populism, and such dramatic situations as the refugee crisis, "The Unbearable Contradiction of a Cynical Democracy" aims to shed some light on a chronology of events that paints a bleak picture for Europeanism and social democracy.

Are democratic systems approaching a point of no return?

They are in a critical, pivotal moment. We are witnessing a crisis of political representation in numerous countries, accompanied by a significant distance between citizens and their representatives. This gap is a clear symptom that something is failing in democratic systems. Consequently, there is an urgent need to find solutions that lead toward a more participatory democracy, where the connection between citizens and representatives is much more dynamic and fluid and where democratic participation is not limited to election time.

Democracy is the political system of the Rule of Law in countries that can today be considered as such. However, the same states are finding themselves increasingly powerless when it comes to the market and powerful financial entities. This very crisis of the state in relation to the market is also impacting the legitimacy of democratic institutions. As a result, citizens become mistrustful of their governments, which fail to deliver on expectations or electoral promises. This occurs at both the national and supranational levels, such as the European Union. A few years ago, we spoke of a "democratic deficit," and now we are faced with a European Union that has many anti-democratic features in its functioning.

Over these years, we have seen a decline in both the social and the political components

What does the European project mean for the survival of democracy?

The European Union was seen as a safe haven where the welfare state was consolidated, with social policies that addressed certain social rights and a space for consolidated democracies. These founding elements enshrined and strengthened political and civil rights. Over these years, however, we have seen a decline in both the social and the political components.

The democratic institutions of the European Union themselves are also in a critical situation, being overwhelmed and sidelined by other political powers, even from within the Union itself. Case in point is the so-called Troika—comprising the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund—which makes decisions that often go beyond or against what elected representatives decide. Furthermore, other issues are also tied to democratic consciousness, such as the refugee crisis or immigration policies, which demonstrate that the European Union is failing as the political project it was initially envisioned to be.

Is it an exhausted model, then?

I have gone as far as to say that as a political project, the European Union is dead. What keeps it alive now is the euro. In order to preserve the currency, the European Union itself is self-destructing with economic policies that run counter to the demands and needs of its citizens. A European Union subjected to the dynamics of a global market from a politically weak position: Europe believed it could spread the European social model to other regions, but the reality is the complete opposite. Under these conditions, dictated by China and other global market players, the European Union is simply powerless, and our future as a political project is uncertain.
