Weight-Loss Win is an original Yahoo Health series that shares the inspiring stories of people who have shed pounds healthfully.

Name: Rachael Brister

Age: 28

Height: 5’6”

Before Weight: 220 pounds

How I Gained It: I’ve struggled with my weight for my entire life. In high school and college, I tried to lose weight through crash dieting, which never worked. After college, I moved back home and the pounds started to creep on. I was eating whatever I wanted and not working out, and my weight continued to climb. By the time I was 26, I was 220 pounds and completely miserable.

The Breaking Point: I really wanted to get married and have children, but a year after I was engaged, I was still overweight and felt like I couldn’t live up to my potential as a wife. My fiancé and I were planning a beach wedding, and I was too self-conscious to even consider wearing a swimsuit. I knew that something had to change.

How I Lost It: I started working with a nutritionist, and we came up with a plan to eat healthier and work out. My fiancé was really supportive, and he helped me to make some lifestyle changes. I started working out six days a week and gradually cut back on my calorie intake. I lost 40 pounds in six months, and I was finally able to fit into a swimsuit for my wedding!

Since Weight-Loss Win: I’ve maintained my weight loss, and I now weigh 131 pounds. I’m so happy with my body now, and I never would have been able to achieve my goal if it weren’t for Weight-Loss Win. I know that I can keep this weight off for the rest of my life, and I’m grateful for the healthy, happy life that I now have.
