I am not fully aware of the incident that took place in a Williamsburg theater during a showing of The Phantom Tollbooth. However, I did observe a middle-aged man hurling profanities at two young women before leaving the theater in a fit of rage. It seemed as though the girls had refused to give up their seats, causing the man to become furious. 

Similarly, I do not have complete knowledge regarding the tragedy that occurred in Santa Barbara. A 22-year-old named Elliot Rodger is believed to have shot six people from his car before taking his own life. Rodger left behind a video rant targeting women who had rejected him, questioning why they were not attracted to him and promising revenge. His family acknowledged that he had been undergoing therapy and had displayed concerning behavior. 

These two incidents, though different in nature and severity, share a common underlying issue: men reacting with anger and violence when they do not receive what they want from women. 

It is easy to dismiss Elliot Rodger as a unique and horrifying case, to claim that it is related to mental health issues rather than a hatred towards women. However, doing so only serves to deny the existence of this hateful sentiment that is far more pervasive than many would like to admit. Denying that this crime was an act of misogyny only enables the continuation of violence against women. 

Killing women as a result of rejection is monstrous, and although the suspect, in this case, may be Elliot Rodger, the real monster is the insidious belief that women owe men sex and should be punished if they do not comply. This notion is reinforced in various ways, from online forums targeting the "involuntarily celibate" to pickup artist workshops. It is present in our media, in everyday conversations, and occasionally even in legal systems. 

Elliot Rodger may have been mentally ill, but that cannot solely account for his actions. The pervasive, harmful voice whispering to all individuals that women must be subservient to men is the real culprit. Instead of merely dismissing such beliefs as insignificant or isolated, we must actively choose to speak out against them. 

This case sadly demonstrates the societal issue of misogyny and the need for change. The Santa Barbara County sheriff deemed the shooting "the work of a madman," but Elliot Rodger's actions demonstrate that we must address the toxic, sexist beliefs that persist in our culture.
