Drones are becoming an increasingly familiar sight in cities across the United States. Thanks to numerous new models being ordered to meet the surging domestic demand, drones are being integrated into various aspects of everyday life. This increase in drone popularity can be partly attributed to Congress' mandate for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to loosen restrictions associated with the use of unmanned aerial systems. This is expected to pave the way for increased utilization of drones by public agencies and eventually, the private sector.

While the FAA's primary concern lies in ensuring the safety of drone operations to prevent accidents and potential conflicts with other aircraft, civil liberty groups are focusing on a more pressing issue: the potential for rampant surveillance. Organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) are all taking measures to emphasize the importance of privacy considerations in relation to drone use.

Under current American privacy law, there is limited protection against drone surveillance within US borders. Citizens typically do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces. Additionally, privacy protection can be quite limited even within visible portions of private property from public vantage points. Companies like Google have taken full advantage of this, incorporating aerial imagery into platforms such as Google Maps and Street View.

With the widespread availability of drones, there are now fewer barriers to aerial surveillance, and this can dramatically change the way law enforcement views the appropriateness of using aerial surveillance methods in various cases. Current legislation seems ill-equipped to handle the potential privacy concerns that may arise from increased drone use.

Recently, cases before the Supreme Court, such as United States v. Jones and Florida v. Jardines, have brought surveillance technology and privacy concerns to the forefront of public debate. In these cases, the primary questions are whether law enforcement agencies need to obtain a warrant before engaging in drone-based surveillance and whether the same privacy considerations should apply to drone usage as they do for traditional surveillance methods.

As drone use becomes more widespread, it is vital that the FAA gives serious thought to potential privacy risks and addresses citizens' concerns surrounding surveillance. Drones are undoubtedly powerful tools with immense potential for a wide range of applications, from aiding in criminal investigations and scientific research to assisting in disaster relief efforts and more.

However, without thoughtful regulations and careful consideration of privacy issues, our increasingly connected world could face a host of unintended consequences as a result of increased drone usage. As drones take to our skies in greater numbers, it is crucial that the FAA takes the necessary steps to ensure that our privacy is not compromised and that the interests of civil liberties groups are appropriately taken into account. This way, the full potential of drone technology can be harnessed without negatively impacting the rights and privacy of citizens.
