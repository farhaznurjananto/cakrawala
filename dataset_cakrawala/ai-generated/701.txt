When should you worry about having so much wealth in the hands of a few? 
 The Great Recession and its bloodless recovery only deepened the economic inequalities that have attracted so much attention. Almost all of the wealth and income gains since then have gone to the top ten of America's richest 1%. 
 The  400 richest Americans have staggering wealth. The combined net worth of the two on the 2015 Forbes 400 list is $2.34 trillion. You can only make this list if you're worth a whopping $1.7 billion. 
  "America's distorted wealth is one of the most important problems of our time." 
 
  Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey, and his 400 richest heirs to his Walmart fortune make up the bottom 61% of the population, or more than 190 million total, according to a new study. We have about the same amount of wealth. Co-authored. 
 This equates to the combined wealth of the country's entire African-American population and his third of the Latino-American population. 
 Some of these 400  are generous philanthropists. But this kind of extreme inequality  undermines social mobility, democracy and economic stability. Even when you're celebrating your entrepreneurial success, is there a point where things go too far? 
 For me, 400 people who have more money than 190 million of their compatriots is exactly the point. 
 Wealth concentration on this scale gives wealthy donors  too much political power, including the means to shape the rules that govern the economy.
