A sudden, loud "THUMP" awakens you from your sleep.

You sit up in bed and look around, trying to figure out what the noise was. After a few moments, you realize that the noise came from outside. You get out of bed and go to the window to see what could have made the noise.

It's dark outside, so you can't see much. However, you can see a large object lying in the middle of your yard. It's too dark to tell what it is, so you grab a flashlight and go outside to investigate.

As you get closer, you can see that the object is a human body. You shine the flashlight on the body and see that it is a man. He is lying on his back with his eyes closed. There is a large gash on his head, and he is not moving.

You check for a pulse and find none. The man is dead.

You call the police and wait for them to arrive. When they do, they begin to investigate the scene. They determine that the man was killed by a blow to the head with a blunt object. They find the murder weapon, a baseball bat, lying nearby.

The police question you about what you were doing outside at night. You tells them that you were walking your dog when you heard the noise and went to investigate. You don't know who the man is, or why he was killed.

The police are able to identify the man as Jeffrey Woods, a local resident who was not well-known. They believe that he was killed because he had something valuable on him, perhaps money or a valuable item. They are not sure what that something might have been.

The police are unable to find any witnesses who saw anything suspicious around the time of the murder, and they are not able to find any clues that lead them to the killer. They are unable to make any arrests in the case, and the case remains unsolved.
