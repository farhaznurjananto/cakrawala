Since I've started teaching, one thing I've noticed is that many students try to learn by rote, but this method is not particularly effective.

One of the reasons that rote learning is not particularly effective is because it can lead to students simply memorizing information without understanding it. This can make it difficult for students to apply what they have learned to new situations or to remember the information in the long term. Additionally, rote learning can be boring and tedious, which can make it difficult for students to stay motivated.

Instead, it is often better for students to learn by doing. This means that they should be encouraged to try out the information they are learning in practice, and to ask questions about it. Additionally, students should be encouraged to challenge themselves with difficult tasks and questions, to increase their understanding and comprehension of the information. By using these strategies, students can learn information effectively and efficiently, which will help them to remember it better and to apply it to new situations.
