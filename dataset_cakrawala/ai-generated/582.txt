In the vast world of politics, President Donald Trump and his aspiring son tread a path of firm opposition to gun regulations. Consequently, the president's voice has been notably absent in the aftermath of the tragic San Bernardino school shooting that unfolded on Monday.

The scene was chilling: 53-year-old Cedric Anderson, a man with a checkered past, stormed North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, California. Amid the chaos, he fatally shot his wife, teacher Karen Elaine Smith, and an innocent 8-year-old student, Jonathan Martinez. In a somber twist, Anderson ultimately turned the gun on himself. A 9-year-old child, whose name remains undisclosed, was injured during the harrowing event and is now recovering in stable condition at a hospital.

Unsurprisingly, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos offered her sympathies after the heart-wrenching incident. Yet, President Trump's lips have been sealed, not a single tweet emerging from his famous Twitter account. However, cast your minds back to August last year when Trump utilized the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, executed by Muslim extremists, as a rallying cry for his controversial proposed ban on Muslim immigration. The silence now continues to hang heavily in the air.
