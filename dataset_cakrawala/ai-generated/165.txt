A WOMAN was airlifted to hospital after she was hit by a train at a level crossing in Coventry.

The incident happened at the notorious Tollbar Island level crossing in London Road, near to the city centre, at about 9.45am yesterday.

The woman, believed to be in her 30s, was knocked unconscious when the train hit her.

It is believed she may have been pushed onto the tracks.

She was airlifted from the scene by the Air Ambulance to the University Hospital at Walsgrave, where she was treated for head injuries.

A police spokesman said: “We received a call at 9.45am this morning to a report of a pedestrian being hit by a train at the level crossing.

“A woman in her 30s was hit by a train. She was airlifted to hospital by the Air Ambulance.

“At this stage it is unclear exactly how she was hit by the train.

“We are investigating whether she was pushed or whether she fell.”

The woman has not been named.
