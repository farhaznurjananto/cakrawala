In a recent episode of MSNBC's "AM Joy," renowned liberal filmmaker Michael Moore brought to light the alarming reality of sexism and misogyny in our society. Through a captivating anecdote about his conversation with a female Trump supporter, Moore underscored how many women have grown up tolerating inappropriate behavior from men, ultimately normalizing and internalizing these harmful attitudes.

Despite the disheartening situation, actor and comedian John Leguizamo provided a powerful call to action, urging us to recognize and confront the deep-seated sexism and misogyny that persist in contemporary society. The fact that 46% of female voters and 53% of white female voters supported Trump is a sobering reminder of the vital work that lies ahead to dismantle these oppressive structures.

Now is the time for us to come together, amplify our voices, and challenge the systemic barriers that continue to perpetuate such destructive beliefs and attitudes. By engaging in open and honest conversations, and advocating for change, we can pave the way for a more equitable and inclusive future for all.
