The federal government is seeking to house unaccompanied migrant children in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, according to a post on a federal contracting website.

The move is the latest federal effort to deal with the surge of Central American families and children coming across the southwest border. In the past, the federal government has used military bases in Oklahoma and Texas to house children, but those are now at capacity, according to the federal posting.

The new federal posting says the federal government is seeking land and facilities “in the western United States” to house children. It specifically mentions California, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
