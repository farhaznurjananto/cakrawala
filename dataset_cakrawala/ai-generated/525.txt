Two people have tragically lost their lives, and three others have been injured following a logging train derailment in Woss, a small, tight-knit community situated in northern Vancouver Island. The unfortunate incident took place at around 8:45 a.m. local time on Thursday, near the Cougar Crescent area, which is about 130 kilometers north of Campbell River. The train in question, owned by Western Forest Products, is believed to have been carrying as many as 11 rail cars filled with logs â€“ a crucial part of the area's economy.

The circumstances of the accident are still unclear, but it is alleged that the train may have been on a runaway trip and unexpectedly encountered maintenance crew members who were working along the rail tracks at the time of the collision. The logging train's derailment has left a significant impact on the small community of roughly 190 people, with the regional district director of Woss, David Rushton, expressing his devastation over the incident.

The three injured workers were quickly airlifted to the hospital. For one individual, it was a harrowing experience, as they were trapped underneath the logs for more than four hours. Nat Pottage, Port Hardy's Unit Chief, praised the efforts of the rescue team, emphasizing that moving the logs to free the trapped individual was nothing short of a heroic act.

Western Forest Products, the owner of the rail line, stated that the train was transporting personnel and material at the time of the derailment. In an official press release, company President and CEO Don Demens said, "We are saddened to report an incident with a train derailment in Woss. The safety and security of our staff and the communities where we work are paramount." Furthermore, the company has pledged to fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation led by the authorities.

Currently, the cause of the train derailment remains unknown, but multiple agencies are taking action to uncover the truth. The RCMP Island District General Investigation Section, the Coroners Service, the Transportation Safety Board, and WorkSafeBC are all actively involved in the investigation process. Additional investigators are expected to join the efforts on Friday, reflecting the importance of understanding the cause of this tragic accident in order to prevent any similar tragedies from happening in the future.
