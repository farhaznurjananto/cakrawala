Ohio Spring Football will showcase Urban Meyer's offense in Ohio for the first time. result? Much like Urban Mayer's offense after his stint in Florida. In fact, much of the term dates back to Meyer's time in Utah. Ohio State's offense clearly reflects Mayer's offensive doctrine. So it's a one-back power run-and-play action game from a shotgun interspersed with reads and optional football. (Disclaimer: I've only seen scrimmage once, so offensive staff may have introduced certain concepts as a means of tackling them and underemphasized others). 
 education and orientation 
 
 OSU's attack was almost completely huddle-free. They were also almost exclusively in shotguns. The only time OSU crouched was in  goal line situations where the yardage was short. They quickly crouch, sprint to the line with Offset I, and  snap quickly to generate power. Otherwise everything was not dense and shotgun. Four different people were assigned to give no-huddle hand signals, similar to what is described here. The Buckeyes mainly he manned a staff of 11 (3 WR, 1 RB, 1 TE). H-backs share the outside leg of the tackle and line up in a "hip" position.The most common appearance is what Smart Football's Chris Brown graphed below (no pre-snap motion) . Buckeye receivers were either  doubles or tight trips. Usually the halfback is placed opposite his end tight. OSU also indicated where the jam would start at the pistol position and where the QB slaps.
