In an industry marked by long queues, delayed flights, overcrowded airplanes, and cancelled travel plans, Henrik Zillmer, co-founder of AirHelp, is passionate about standing up for the rights of passengers, enabling them to fight back when things go wrong. The idea behind AirHelp is simple: help air travel customers from all around the world get paid for flight delays, overbooking, and cancellations. 

Zillmer became interested in the industry when he faced flight troubles in his personal life. Frustrated with the lack of accountability and transparency from airlines, he decided to take the issue into his own hands. He started researching the laws, international flight guidelines, and legal cases against airlines. After years of gathering information and advocating for consumer rights, he realised that there were 26 million passengers every year who were legally entitled to hundreds of dollars in compensation, but only being paid less than 1% of the total amount they were owed. 

Armed with this information, Zillmer founded AirHelp in 2013 along with Nicolas Michaelsen and Greg Roodt. The company aims to help those who have been denied compensation after flight troubles or have been ignored by airlines when claiming for it. This compensation service, which is based on a contingency model, fights for the rights of passengers and demands fair compensation from airlines. When the passenger receives the compensation, the company takes a 25% cut. 

One of the main reasons why airline customers drop their compensation claims is that the process is often complicated, cumbersome, and time-consuming, requiring them to collate and send multiple documents to several entities. This is where AirHelp comes in: its main goal is to support customers with its expertise in the field and regulatory requirements, making sure that they receive the compensation they deserve. AirHelp's algorithm collects publicly available data on delayed flights, combines it with national, international, and regional laws, and cross-checks it against previous court rulings. Using this data, the company can determine the amount of compensation owed to passengers, file a claim on their behalf, and ensure that each claim is processed as efficiently and correctly as possible. 

One of the biggest challenges that AirHelp faces in its mission is getting the airlines to take their claims seriously. Zillmer reveals that airlines often play dirty, like requiring AirHelp to supply them with a signed power of attorney form for every client. Although many airlines insist that board passes are required, some passengers now use mobile boarding passes, leading to confusion and delays in the compensation process. According to Zillmer, airlines are not meeting their responsibilities as service providers, leading to repeat customers and low consumer satisfaction ratings. 

In addition to helping individual passengers, AirHelp also works to raise awareness about consumer rights within the airline industry. The company is encouraging customers to hold airlines more accountable for their mistakes and increasing the likelihood of getting compensation if there is a problem during their flight. AirHelp prioritises customer support and has successfully dealt with over 20 court cases, winning nearly all of them. 

The company's platform has been enjoyed by tens of thousands of people worldwide, with many customers commending AirHelp’s customer service, speed, and ease of use. At TechCrunch Disrupt in New York, Zillmer unveiled a new email tool to help passengers sift through their emails and determine whether their flights from up to three years ago were entitled to compensation. With a funding round currently underway, Zillmer plans to expand the company further, potentially offering airport concierge services to ensure that customers always get the support they need. 

AirHelp’s business model is at the forefront of a growing trend in the start-up industry of firms seeking to fight back against corporations and protect the rights of consumers. While the airlines may continue to play dirty, Zillmer and his team continue their ongoing efforts to support passengers and ensure that airlines live up to their responsibilities.
