The French Open is a must-attend event for tennis enthusiasts and players, as well as anyone seeking an opportunity to witness some of the best tennis players worldwide. The tournament is held annually in May, and players from around the world gather in Paris to perform at one of the most prestigious sporting venues worldwide, Roland-Garros.

It is not just about playing and watching tennis - this event also presents an opportunity to explore Paris, one of the world's most romanticized cities. A visit to Roland-Garros offers a perfect opportunity to make the most of Paris, and here is how tennis lovers can capitalise on their time in this beautiful city.

At Roland-Garros, the ticketing options are plenty, catering to diverse preferences. The event runs for two weeks, and packages range from grounds passes, weekend passes, evening sessions, and single tickets, all offering an excellent chance to see dozens of the world's top tennis professionals. To get closer to the tennis players, it is advisable to buy a grounds pass. They are affordable, and one can access all peripheral courts around the facility except for the three main stadiums. There's much to watch from the peripheral courts, as one can get a glimpse of stellar tennis from the front row. To catch all the action from the three main stadiums, one can watch the live shows on the big screens outside the stadium. Moreover, in case scheduling conflicts prohibit onsite viewing, the Hôtel de Ville (Paris's city hall) live streams matches on a jumbo screen - and one can pack a picnic basket while at it. Pubs and cafes throughout the city also offer live streaming of the action.

When it comes to accommodations, staying near Roland-Garros, which is west of central Paris, is highly recommended. There are various rental apartments available on HomeAway, offering views of the Eiffel Tower and a chic Parisian vibe. One can also walk from the apartments to the facility, which is quite convenient. Alternatively, take the Metro lines Nine or Ten. For those who prefer hotels, the super-luxe Park Hyatt Paris-Vendôme has been Federer and Sharapova's choice hotel during tournaments past.

For those interested in tennis history, the facility has a tennis museum located within its grounds, displaying tennis memorabilia and European tennis history in contemporary art, cartoons, photography, and sculpture.

Playing tennis oneself is also an excellent idea, with various courts around the city offering a chance to brush up one's skills. One can reserve court time or plan for lessons with a local pro at the French gardens of the Jardin du Luxembourg or Tennis de l'Atlantique.

Food is an essential aspect of visiting Paris, and the French Open has some of the best on-site food among all grand slams, according to journalists and spectators. Croque monsieurs and cheese and charcuterie plates are popular, and one can enjoy them while watching tennis at Suzanne-Lenglen or Center Court. Restaurants such as Apicius, which has a global reputation, and La Grande Cascade, which offers classic Parisian cuisine, are worthy splurges. After a day in the sun, French player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga recommends Berthillon in Île Saint-Louis for a sweet treat.

As the busy day comes to an end, a river boat tour along the Seine with Roland-Garros is a perfect way to relax before night matches. The boat's top deck offers a chance to watch matches while sipping on classic drinks such as a French 75.
