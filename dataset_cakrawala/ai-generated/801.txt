One of my long-term employees has a popular, straightforward Indian name, but long before I was employed, she was given a nickname, which is a westernized version of her name. She mentioned that she despises the moniker, wishes people would just use her true name, and has never felt comfortable asking people to do so when we were talking about my (somewhat uncommon) name one day. She accepted when I volunteered to act as her manager and said she would appreciate it. Many members of the team are just referring to her by her nickname because of the varied but typically negative reactions. According to the general opinion, it "looks prettier" or her name "isn't very feminine." She finds it difficult to be impolite when asked directly, so she will just reply that she likes her full name. Now that the moniker has reached this stage, I have to tell my new senior manager that it is inappropriate because staff members have told her that the term is preferred. I discussed this with one team member today, and she said that she will continue to use the nickname when referring to the person with the nickname to coworkers, clients, or directly to her unless she is notified by the person with the nickname that she "only wants to be called by her other name." Although I believe that this is wildly inappropriate, there doesn't seem to be much I can do about it since my staff member lacks the confidence to handle it more forcefully. Nevertheless, it looks at the very least disrespectful. Should I pursue what most of the team perceives as a small problem any further or should I let it go in the hopes that my team member will assert herself? This brings to mind the manager's letter from last week, in which the employee complained about bullying a coworker over her prosthetic leg. You need to utilize your authority to halt something offensive, just like that manager did. Nobody needs to be persuaded to act respectfully; you only need to make them aware that it's required. The conduct of your employees here is, to put it bluntly, abhorrent. Because her real name isn't "beautiful" or "feminine" enough for them, they want to westernize it. No. You must demand that they behave appropriately and not like the huge assholes they are now being because they are being offensive and racist. Speak to each offender one-on-one and state the following: "aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaa It's Parvati, not Polly, who goes by that name. You must now refer to her by her legal name, as she has requested that we do. Please refrain from doing so going forward and refer to her as Parvati instead." Immediately put an end to any nonsense you may hear about "not unless she informs me personally that she only wants to be addressed by her real name." As you say: "No. She has requested to be named Parvati, and I expect you to call her by that name without causing her any trouble. I'm saying this up front and clearly. Would you be willing to carry out that request?" Can you agree to do that? is the last question you ask because you want the other person to make a firm commitment right away. If they are still hesitant, you want to find out before you conclude the conversation. But you must do this without a doubt. While your employee has made it very obvious that she likes her given name, you cannot allow her coworkers to choose to westernize it for their own convenience. Stop it right now. This is very terrible.
