The FIA is considering introducing a new power unit for 2021 that could be used across a range of motorsport championships. FIA president Jean Todt has proposed that this unit could be used in the World Endurance Championship (WEC) in place of the current LMP1 engines, in order to make the sport more accessible for manufacturers.

Todt believes that a new engine formula could help to bring manufacturers back to WEC, as the category has been significantly weakened after Porsche's departure for 2018. He also believes that cost and complexity need to be addressed in order to make the sport more attractive to new entrants.

The proposal has been put to the teams and manufacturers involved in Formula One and WEC, and the FIA will continue to explore the possibilities of a new engine formula that could be used across multiple championships.
