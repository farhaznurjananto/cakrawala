The recent rise of grime in the UK music scene has been a significant and disruptive force, according to a new report by Ticketmaster. Recognised as one of the most important musical developments in the UK in recent decades, grime has been compared to punk in terms of its power and ability to energise a disillusioned section of UK youth. Despite 73% of people being aware of this genre, only 43% say they listen to it. Mykaell Riley, the director of the Black Music Research Unit at the University of Westminster, believes that grime is an outsider which challenges contemporary music production, lyrical and performance aesthetics. However, grime has been diversely received outside of its fans, with a significant number of people continuing to associate it with more negative connotations. 
The rise in grime has had a considerable impact on the UK music industry, as evidenced by the quadrupling of grime events on sale through Ticketmaster since 2010. In fact, the number of grime streams has more than doubled over the past year, with 206 million in 2017 compared to 86 million in 2016, as BPI figures show. Moreover, the report found that the Grime4Corbyn campaign attracted significant support from prominent grime artists in the build-up to the 2017 general election. A total of 2,000 general music fans participated in the survey, and whilst 73% are aware of grime, only 22% are actual fans. As a whole, grime artists appear to be an intelligent group, with a strong understanding of the music industry and their potential impact. 
Despite its growing popularity, there is some evidence of unease amongst original grime fans regarding the genre’s rising mainstream presence. This is due to the perception that the genre’s roots and initial influences are being compromised by its movement towards mainstream success. 
Overall, the continued evolution of grime has challenged how young audiences consume and identify UK’s contemporary music. While the shape of the genre in the future remains unclear, its impact has been undeniably transformative.
