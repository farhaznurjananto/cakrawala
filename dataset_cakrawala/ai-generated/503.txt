House Speaker Paul Ryan added a dash of intrigue to the swirling political atmosphere when he declared in a recent interview with Yahoo News that any candidate emerging from the Republican primary, including the much-debated Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, would make a far more superior president than the current occupant of the White House, Barack Obama.

Ryan, well-known for maintaining a staunch neutral stance in the presidential primary race, couldn't help but offer his viewpoint on the prowess of the present contenders jostling for the limelight, ready to seize the moment.

When probed about his erstwhile 2012 running mate Mitt Romney's infamous disapproval of Trump, Ryan artfully sidestepped the question. Nonetheless, his past public disavowal of Trump's plan to impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States on the grounds that it contradicts the essence of conservatism echoes in the minds of many.

Adding to the forthcoming festivities of the election season, Ryan shall co-host a forum on poverty with GOP presidential candidates this weekend in South Carolina. In an interesting twist, he's partnering with Senator Tim Scott for this affair. Despite the absence of front-runners Trump and Cruz from the guestlist, Ryan remains undeterred, radiating enthusiasm for the ongoing Republican primary.

The House Speaker, relishing the unfolding political drama, shared his excitement with the interviewer, stating, "I like the fact that the action is on our side of the aisle. I like the idea that people are talking about the Republican primary because thatâ€™s where the vibrant debate is."
