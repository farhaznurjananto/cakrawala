The savage beating of Calvin Nicol on Rideau Street in 2014 is undisputed. However, since the beginning, the case against his alleged attackers has been fraught with uncertainty. On Tuesday, they were acquitted and released from jail.

Ontario Court Justice Matthew Webber ruled that there was a considerable amount of reasonable doubt in the identification case, plagued by a blurry security tape, a detective's error, and the fact that the victim had limited opportunity to see his attackers during the brutal assault. Moreover, Nicol identified the wrong man in the prisoner's dock when asked to do so at trial.

Nicol, a 31-year-old piercer and artist, was not acquainted with his attackers and reported the incident to the police three days after the attack when someone visited his studio and threatened to finish the job and kill him.

Two other Crown witnesses, both friends of Nicol, could not recognize James Picody as the man who delivered the threats. They also testified that they had never seen him before and had relied on what others had told them to form their suspicion about who made the threat. When asked to identify the accused in the prisoner's box, one witness couldn't and said, "I didn't get a good look at him."

Picody and his co-accused, Timothy Smith, were both found not guilty of aggravated assault. The court also heard that a police detective made a critical error when he secured only 11 minutes of security tape from the McDonald's Nicol sought refuge in to escape his assailants. The video, which was shown at trial, doesn’t show Nicol, covered in blood, running for his life through the McDonald’s hallway.

Justice Webber said that had the detective secured the rest of the tape, police would have been able to establish the attack's timeframe. Webber called it police oversight. The detective testified that he was more focused on the accused attackers than on the victim.

A police constable testified that he couldn't say for certain if the man he arrested days after the attack was indeed the same man in the security footage from McDonald's because the suspect's face was not clear in the video image.

Nicol was assaulted while walking home from work shortly after 7 p.m. on November 1, right after someone called him a freak with horns (Nicol has silicone horns, a forked tongue, and tattooed eyeballs). Picody and Smith, both 32, were denied bail and spent months in jail awaiting trial.

Since their release, Nicol has been living in fear. "I'm frightened. They destroyed my life, and they're walking around. I feel like there is no justice," said Nicol, whose injuries have left him unable to work as a piercer.
