Donald Trump, faced with his own defeat in November, is making a last-ditch effort to save his presidency by turning the election into a race war.

Trump made his latest move Sunday morning, tweeting a video of two white men in a car shouting "white power" at anti-Trump protesters in Florida. The video also showed a group of anti-Trump protesters shouting "Fuck you, nigger" at a white Trump supporter.

The tweet was quickly deleted, but not before it was retweeted by the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.

The president's supporters have long accused Democrats of trying to "steal" the election, and Trump has been stoking those fears in recent days. On Saturday, he tweeted that the election "will be rigged" if mail-in voting is allowed.

Trump's tweet came just hours after he denounced racism and violence in the wake of the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead.

But Sunday's video seems to be an attempt to change the subject, and it's unclear what message the president is trying to send.

The video is controversial, and it's likely to further inflame tensions in a country already divided along partisan lines.

Trump's strategy

Trump's strategy seems to be twofold. First, he's trying to create a sense of panic among his supporters, hoping that they'll turn out in droves to vote in the upcoming midterms.

Second, Trump is trying to muddy the waters by attacking the media and Democrats, which he believes will motivate his base.

So far, Trump's strategy seems to be failing. The president's approval ratings are low, and his own party is divided.

The midterms

The midterms are still a year away, but the president's strategy could have a significant impact on the outcome.

If Trump's supporters turn out in droves to vote, it could help the Republicans win back the House of Representatives.

But if the president's strategy inflames tensions further, it could lead to violence and even more political chaos.
