Richard Fuld, the former CEO of the now-defunct Lehman Brothers, disclosed to the US Congress that he earned around $300 million in salary and bonuses during the eight years leading up to the bank's bankruptcy. This revelation was made during Fuld's testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which was conducting its initial inquiry into the root causes of the financial crisis.

This congressional hearing occurred during a period of extreme stock market volatility, characterized by plummeting stock prices in both Europe and the United States. Henry Waxman, the Committee chairman, emphasized in his opening statement that the ongoing credit freeze threatened the stability of the global economy. Waxman further argued that the path to economic recovery entailed the identification of the crisis's origins and the subsequent implementation of financial market reforms.

In response to Waxman's questioning regarding his compensation package, Fuld clarified that the correct figure was approximately $300 million. Fuld asserted that Lehman Brothers' compensation committee expended considerable effort in ensuring that the interests of executives, employees, and shareholders were suitably aligned. Despite this justification, Waxman criticized Fuld for advocating multi-million dollar bonuses for executives shortly before the bank's downfall.

Throughout the hearing, Fuld expressed his deep regret over the situation and assumed "full responsibility for the decisions [he] made and for the actions [he] took." Moreover, Fuld defended his actions by explaining that they were deemed appropriate and prudent based on the information available to him at the time.
