On Tuesday, the people who live near Ruben Acosta's Delano restaurant are getting together to put on a huge fundraiser for him. Acosta, who is 58 years old, is still in the hospital after someone shot him on June 9 at his restaurant, Ruben's Mexican Grill at 915 W. Douglas. During a robbery, he was shot twice, and Acosta also fired back. Reginald Kane, who is 26 years old, has been booked into jail and is being held on suspicion of first-degree attempted murder, aggravated robbery, criminal possession of a firearm, and three counts of aggravated assault. Jessica Demieville, Acosta's granddaughter, said that his condition hadn't changed since Monday. She said he's had at least six surgeries, and now he's stable but not getting better.

Here's who will be there. Picasso's Pizzeria, 621 W. Douglas: The restaurant will give away the money made from selling slices of a special taco pizza that isn't usually on the menu. The owner, Kurt Schmidt, said that people can choose between beef and chicken as a topping. The Monarch, at 579 W. Douglas: This popular Delano bar will sell a Reuben sandwich in honor of Acosta and give the money they make from it to his family. Chips will be served with the sandwiches. 710 W. Douglas, Delano Barbecue Company: The money made from its smoked Reuben sandwiches and smoked chicken fajita salads will be given to charity by the barbecue restaurant. Also, the brewery at 117 N. Handley in Delano, Aero Plains Brewing, has changed the name of its Mexican Lager to "Ruben's Revenge" and is donating $2 of every $6 pint sold until the beer runs out. The owner, Lance Minor, said that the brewery has raised about $600 so far. Tanya's Soup Kitchen also held a fundraiser for the Acosta family two weekends ago. All of the money made from sales of its Friday and Saturday special went to the family. The restaurant's Facebook page says that it sold 60 orders of the special in 30 minutes on Saturday and then ran out. For the rest of the night, it sold Reuben sandwiches and gave the money from those sales to charity as well. Last week, Ruben's Mexican Grill reopened after being closed for a week while employees, friends, and family cleaned up after the shooting. It's open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
