Although it would appear that the current Heat roster is more athletic and full of life than the one that was used to acquire the Dragic brothers (Shawne Williams, Danny Granger, Justin Hamilton, and Norris Cole were traded), the team is still having trouble contending with a large number of injuries. Is it possible for us to win enough of the remaining games despite the absence of Chris Bosh and the erratic play of Hassan Whiteside and still qualify for the playoffs? Is it unrealistic for Heat fans to expect more from the group that takes the court, given the current state of affairs (such as winning games on their home court and against teams that are not in the elite division)? Dwayne Wade's performance in the final quarter of Monday's game was particularly noteworthy, and as a result, I don't believe he is capable of improving upon the amount of time he spends on the court. — Michael, Miami A: If what you're asking is whether or not the Heat have all of a sudden become a long shot to make the playoffs, then I don't think you're off base in thinking that. According to the ratings provided by ESPN, the Heat have a chance of making the playoffs that is lower than thirty percent. After playing at home against the Nets on Wednesday, the upcoming schedule goes as follows: at Toronto on Friday, at home next Monday against the Cleveland, and then at home two nights later against Portland. This is the problem, which is even more of a problem than the roster, and perhaps even as much of a problem as the injuries. After that, there are games scheduled in Oklahoma City, Atlanta, and Cleveland, in addition to games against the Spurs, the Bulls, and the Raptors that will take place at home. The Heat lost a significant number of games that they needed to win. They are now being forced to pay the price in the form of a closing schedule that is less forgiving than they had hoped. Hassan must avoid making careless fouls if he wants to be successful. — Staten Island, New York, and Dallas A: Absolutely. In point of fact, I believe that this factor contributes to his outbursts of rage more than some people have given it credit for. I believe that if he were able to keep the foul trouble to a minimum, he wouldn't experience the same level of frustration with other situations. As was the case on Monday, there is no reason to be fouling players who are shooting jump shots. The next thing you'll learn is to figure out which rebounds you can afford to give up. Once more, this is all a part of his late-evolving maturation in the NBA. Should we try to trade Whiteside for future draft picks assuming that we will be able to get him playing at a good level before the end of the season? I believe that it is possible for us to acquire a couple of first-round picks. — Michael, Oviedo. A: No, that's a ridiculous idea. The most important thing for this team to do is to get a good look at Whiteside while they also have Bosh, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Josh McRoberts, and the rest of the roster together (and everyone should be healthy). This will allow them to see how all of these different moving parts can interact with one another. To tell you the truth, when you have Whiteside, Bosh, McRoberts, Deng, Dragic, and Wade on your team, I'm not sure how many draft picks you need to slot alongside them. Now, if it becomes a concern that Whiteside will leave in free agency in 2016, there is always the possibility that this issue can be resolved before the 2016 trading deadline.
