Title: Assessing the Contender: Warhammer Online

As World of Warcraft (WoW) dominates the MMORPG market with over 10 million subscribers, Electronic Arts (EA) takes on the challenge to compete with Activision-Blizzard's massively-multiplayer online role-playing game through their newly-released Warhammer Online. Two months into its launch, let's examine if EA has managed to make its mark in the gaming industry.

Venturing into Warhammer Online, it is apparent that EA Mythic has invested a substantial amount of resources into this project. With an extensive beta-testing phase and a spectacular launch, the game exudes potential and quality. Not only is the game free from unplanned down-time, but developers have also skillfully managed player populations. Any issues encountered during the gameplay are standard post-launch problems encountered in every MMO.

The game's combat system is fascinating and invigorating, blending unique class-specific mechanisms with conventional Western MMO styles. This combination adds richness and depth to the gameplay, ensuring that the click-and-cast combat remains engaging for the players. 

Warhammer Online's strong customization systems offer great support for player character individualization. A mechanically driven ladder-based talent mechanism, linear approach to character enhancement, as well as a visually appealing trophy system, all contribute to the distinctiveness of each player on the battlefield. Complemented by colored dyes, the game's aesthetics are further enhanced.

Moreover, the game's interface prioritizes user-friendliness, equipping players with an in-game UI editor that allows convenient alterations without any extra knowledge. The polished game fundamentals pave the way for Warhammer's unmatched player-versus-player (PVP) combat, which has undeniably become its key asset.

Offering players a variety of instance-based scenario combat options, the flexibility it provides in jumping in and out of encounters sets Warhammer a league above the rest. Along with PVP, EA Mythic has also introduced some groundbreaking features in the player versus environment (PVE) space, such as the Public Questing system. This unique mechanism simplifies multi-man raids, making them more enjoyable by resolving numerous social impediments.

Additionally, the "Tome of Knowledge," Warhammer's in-game digital encyclopedia, supports PVE with an extensive collection of lore, quests, and rewards. Overall, with its enticing mix of enjoyable combat mechanisms, customization, and innovation, Warhammer Online emerges as a worthy contender in the MMORPG market.
