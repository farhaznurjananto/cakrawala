Facebook is releasing the hardware design of its server called Big Sur, which is used for training artificial intelligence (AI) software. By doing this, other companies working on AI can create similar systems. Big Sur is a part of Facebook's Open Compute Project, which runs machine learning programs that help manage large data sets efficiently. Big Sur relies on GPUs, making it a more efficient choice compared to CPUs for machine learning tasks. Facebook claims its GPU-based system is twice as fast as the previous versions. The intention of sharing Big Sur's design is to encourage other companies to test the hardware, provide feedback and improvements. Facebook also plans to triple its investment in GPUs to expand machine learning capabilities across its services.
