Danger: Deep Water read the sign behind Nick Clegg who visited the hedgehog sanctuary yesterday. The Liberal Democrat leader has launched his  campaign in an unpromising environment. At least he can display an elegant irony as he steers his ship toward disaster. 
 The LDP was once able to wield the power of a kingmaker in a suspended parliament. Now that role is taken by Scottish nationalists. The party has been overtaken by the Greens in Ukip polls  and in some places. Defining the concept of 'liberal democracy' in Britain has never been easy. Not needed now. There are even “dumpster” votes and competition  from political parties with a purpose. 
 Clegg's performance in the 2010 election debate was so overwhelming that he was hailed as the second-greatest politician after Churchill. I rudely wrote  that this is as good as it gets.Clegg is a kingmaker, not a king. And the king, once made, would seize him with cowardly obedience. 
 Cameron filled the government with senior Liberal Democrat leaders, proving their enduring loyalty.  
 Few gave the coalition  five years. There were too many angry Tories and rebellious Liberal Democrats, and it was almost certain that the Liberal Democrats would collapse at the ballot box as a result. But Clegg handled his inevitable humiliation with skill and  panache. The party's early attempts to ally with the Callaghan administration in 1977 by David Steele failed.
