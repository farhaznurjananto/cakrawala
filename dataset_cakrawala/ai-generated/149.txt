At least five families of U.S. soldiers have received letters from a private collection agency demanding that they repay more than $2,600 in enlistment bonuses and benefits, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The soldiers were all from the same unit, the California National Guard's 133rd Military Police Company, engaged in the war on drugs in the 1990s. The National Guard, however, has told the collection agency to stop pursing the debt.

The Times reported that the soldiers were offered bonuses of between $2,000 and $7,500 to re-enlist in the National Guard in 2002. But if they did not complete the six-year obligation, they were required to repay the bonus.

In 2010, the federal government audited the California National Guard and determined that nearly 10,000 soldiers had been given improper bonuses between 2004 and 2010.

The Times reported that these soldiers were asked to repay the bonuses, and about 1,700 soldiers agreed to do so. But many of the soldiers who did not repay the bonuses were identified by the National Guard and have since been pursued by collection agencies, the Times reported.

The Times reported that the National Guard told the collection agency to stop pursuing the debt and to begin negotiating with the soldiers to have the debt forgiven.

"We want to work with the soldiers to come to a resolution," Maj. Gen. John F. Deasy, the National Guard Bureau director, told the Times. "We don't want them to have any more debt than they have to."

The Times reported that the collection agency, which is called National Collection Agency, has contacted the soldiers in letters that state they owe money for enlistment bonuses, federal income tax refunds, housing allowances and other benefits.

The Times reported that the soldiers have been left with few options. Some have filed for bankruptcy, while others have been told to sell their homes and cars to pay the debt.

The National Guard Bureau has said that it will forgive any debts that are more than 10 years old. But many of the soldiers who owe money for enlistment bonuses are more than 10 years old and have no hope of having the debt forgiven.

"I was embarrassed, ashamed and humiliated," one of the soldiers, who did not repay the bonuses, told the Times. "I thought I was doing the right thing and now I have this debt that I can't never pay off."

The National Guard Bureau said that the collection agency is not authorized
