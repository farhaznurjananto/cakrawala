Electronic music artist Slow Magic has successfully crafted a shroud of mystery around himself, incorporating authentic percussion instruments into his performances while donning a wolf mask to conceal his identity. Known solely by his stage name, Slow Magic's decision to maintain this enigmatic persona has piqued the interest of fans and critics alike. In a conversation with The Huffington Post, he explained, "When I started Slow Magic, I wanted it to be separate from a place, face, or identity. It is interesting to be presented with just the art and experience that first." By embracing this approach, the artist has created a captivating world that can only be experienced through his music and live performances.

Slow Magic's critically acclaimed album, How to Run Away, features a mesmerizing blend of nostalgic and cosmic elements that seamlessly transport listeners to the vivid scenery the artist has envisioned. One extraordinary track, "Hold Still," showcases rich melodies and fluid transitions, ultimately leading to an unexpected and enthralling piano performance.

The remarkable artistry evident in How to Run Away has led to its recognition as one of the top electronic albums of 2014, solidifying Slow Magic's reputation as both an enigmatic and prodigiously talented figure in the world of electronic music.
