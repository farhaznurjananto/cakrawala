Mary Caitrin Mahoney and the Starbucks Massacre: The Myths and Facts

In July 1997, a triple murder occurred at the Starbucks on Wisconsin Avenue, NW, in Washington, DC, where former Clinton White House intern Mary Caitrin Mahoney along with her co-workers, Aaron Goodrich and Emory Evans were fatally shot. The case gained attention because of Mahoney’s political background and her association with the Clinton White House. It is considered to be important enough that Snopes.com has it as the first one to "debunk" in the Clinton Body Count, ahead of Vince Foster, which is #2.

The celebrated author and lawyer David Baldacci had a TV documentary in 2006, “Murder by the Book,” in which he perpetuated the myth that the petty criminal Carl Derek Cooper, who was clearly railroaded by what passes for our justice system, was the sole guilty party. It is also of considerable interest that Bradley Garrett of the FBI was the “lead investigator” in the case. He was also right on the ground floor of the FBI cover-up of the Vince Foster murder and in the Chandra Levy case, which has now been reopened. The dubious methods by which the Levy and Mahoney case convictions were obtained were very similar.

Mahoney was a political live wire, a co-founder of a Baltimore organization known as the Lesbian Avengers and a former Clinton White House intern. Joseph Farah has written, "I have reports from sources close to [Monica] Lewinsky quoting her as saying she feared ending up like 'Caity' Mahoney."

The evidence suggests that Cooper was no more the murderer of Mahoney and her co-workers, Aaron Goodrich and Emory Evans, than Foster was the murderer of himself. For the reasons that Farah gives in his article, it is natural to suspect a Clinton connection of some sort to the deaths. The reasons only multiplied when the federal justice system under Bill Clinton was perverted in order to send a 30-year-old patsy to prison for the rest of his life for the murders, and there were threats to those who wrote about it.

The case against Carl Derek Cooper, who is black, was explicitly weak, and one of the nation’s capital's two house organs, The Washington Times, presented highly selective and prejudicial evidence, virtually screaming for Cooper's execution. The evidence against him in the Starbucks and the cop shooting was also unconvincing. There was no evidence of a so-called Cooper crime spree, and it is possible that they withheld it from the public because it was weaker than what they had on him in those two crimes. 

In spite of its obvious importance, Roger Stone and Robert Morrow make no mention of the Mahoney murder in their otherwise very powerful and hard-hitting “The Clinton’s War on Women.” Furthermore, neither Joe Farah nor his World Net Daily had any follow-up to their strong article about Cooper's arrest and subsequent conviction. With Hillary Clinton running for president, now is the time for all of us to say more.
