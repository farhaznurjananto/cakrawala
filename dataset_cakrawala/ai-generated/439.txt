The United States has started the process of removing Cuba from its blacklist of “terrorist” countries, which shows progress in normalising the relations between the two countries. President Barack Obama submitted a report to Congress informing them that Cuba had not contributed to terrorism in the past six months, and had given assurances that it would not support any act of terrorism in the future. In accordance with US law, the President is required to inform Congress 45 days before the directive comes into force. Congress does not need to validate the President’s decision, but it can decide to take action to override his recommendation, and the President could, in turn, veto such a joint resolution of Congress. 

In the last 33 years, Cuba has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement, “Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated as a state sponsor of terrorism because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America. Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago.” In response to this news, Cuba’s Foreign Relations Ministry said, “The government of Cuba recognizes the just decision taken by the President of the United States to remove Cuba from a list on which it never should have been included since our country has already been the victim of hundreds of acts of terrorism that have cost 3,478 lives, and incapacitated 2,099 Cuban citizens.” 

South Florida Republican Representative, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, condemned the decision, stating that it was “a miscarriage of justice borne out of political motivations not rooted in reality.” Similarly, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called it a “terrible” decision because Cuba remains a state sponsor of terrorism. Whilst others praised this action as one that could become a first step toward a new era in US-Cuba relations. 

Senator Benjamin Cardin said that removing Cuba from the list was “an important step forward in our efforts to forge a more fruitful relationship with Cuba”. In contrast, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart claimed that the administration jeopardised US national security with its action to absolve Cuba of its “anti-American terrorist activities” across the globe. 

Negotiations are ongoing in order to get respective embassies open and diplomatic ties re-established. US officials have said that the conversations that the President had with Cuban leader Raúl Castro in Panama last week were productive. 

There is no doubt that Cuba’s presence on the terrorist list has had various consequences for the country. The removal will help Cuba gain access to financial markets and have representation in multilateral financial institutions. Cuba’s removal from the terror list should make it easier for its missions to find a bank, as its presence on the list made banks reluctant to handle the accounts of its diplomatic missions in Washington and at the United Nations. Additionally, Cuba’s removal from the list will be instrumental in facilitating Cuba’s full integration into the international financial system and supporting a stronger economy in which Cubans can thrive and US businesses can invest,” said Jason Marczak, deputy director of the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.

The White House has based its decision on “facts,” namely the repeated rejection of terrorism in speeches by high Cuban officials, Cuba’s ratification of certain international treaties, and high-level assurances that Cuba did not intend to support international terrorism in the future. 

Cuba was added to the list of state sponsors of terrorism on March 1, 1982, because of its training and arming of communist rebels in Africa and Latin America. However, in its most recent report on worldwide terrorism in 2013, the State Department said that “There was no indication that the Cuban government had provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups.”
