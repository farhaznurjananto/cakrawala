Microsoft's latest earnings release has been hailed as a success, proving that the Surface is not a failure, despite some initial criticism. With a revenue of $23.20 billion, $908 million of which came from Microsoft's Surface division, the company's FY15 Q1 represented record first quarter revenue for Microsoft. The success can be attributed to the innovation of CEO Satya Nadella and the restructuring surrounding Nokia Devices and Services.

In addition to the strong performance of the Surface, the Devices and Consumer divisions also saw a revenue increase of 47% to $10.96 billion, while commercial revenues rose by 10% to $12.28 billion. It was a fantastic quarter for Microsoft, with growth in a number of other areas as well. The company achieved success in phone hardware, pulling in over $2.6 billion in revenue, and Xbox sales grew by 104% to 2.4 million.

Moreover, Microsoft recorded a 128% boost in Cloud revenue thanks to Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM. The company also boasts of more than 7 million Office 365 Home and Personal subscribers. It was indeed an impressive quarter for Microsoft, as it recorded growth in almost all business areas.

The company's CEO, Satya Nadella, has expressed his satisfaction with the company's performance. In his statement, he said, "We are innovating faster, engaging more deeply across the industry, and putting our customers at the center of everything we do, all of which positions Microsoft for future growth. Our teams are delivering on our core focus of reinventing productivity and creating platforms that empower every individual and organization."

With the launch of Windows 10 next year, Microsoft is looking to continue to grow and increase the impact of the operating system on their income. Microsoft is confident that its innovative approach to its products and services, as well as its keenness to provide value to its customers, will place the company in a stronger position to deliver growth and contribute to the industry. The future for Microsoft looks bright, with the company continuing to reinvent productivity and create platforms that empower every individual and organization.
