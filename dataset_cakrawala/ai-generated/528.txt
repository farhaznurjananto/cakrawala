President Obama might soon face an increasingly challenging situation concerning the necessary funding for an anticipated surge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Recent comments made by House Appropriations Chairman David Obey serve as clear evidence of the mounting conflict surrounding this issue.

In an interview with ABC News, Obey issued a warning to Obama, stating, "There won't be any money available for other crucial programs if we invest everything into Afghanistan. If the administration asks for an increased commitment of troops, I will push for them to provide financing for it." Obeyâ€™s strong position on this matter exposes the emerging disagreement between various entities.

This tension arises at a critical time when the Obama administration is already experiencing pressure from Democrats in Congress to boost federal spending, in the hope of stimulating job growth within the country. However, according to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration shows a preference for adopting "targeted measures that would be less likely to inflate the deficit." This approach demonstrates their effort to balance the demands of the ongoing war with domestic economic concerns.

Additionally, an ongoing debate persists over the actual cost of deploying more troops in Afghanistan. Recently, the LA Times reported that the estimates provided by the Obama administration and the Pentagon significantly differ. According to the Pentagon's original calculations, the cost would be $500,000 per year for each service member, bringing the total additional expense to an estimated $20 billion per year if General Stanley A. McChrystal's request for 40,000 more troops is approved.

In stark contrast, the White House has recently doubled that figure, placing the cost at $1 million for each new soldier deployed, as stated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Interestingly, the LA Times points out that a Pentagon comptroller's recent calculations came much closer to the OMB's higher estimate than the Pentagon's initial budgeting. This inconsistency further fuels the discussion regarding the feasibility and financial impact of expanding military resources in Afghanistan.

In conclusion, the mounting debate over funding the expected buildup of U.S. troops in Afghanistan places President Obama in a difficult position, forcing him to balance the concerns of various factions while maintaining focus on domestic issues such as job growth and economic stability.
