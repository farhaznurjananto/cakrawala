In a recent interview on 60 Minutes, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke brought attention to the pressing issue of the United States' rising wealth and income inequality, referring to it as a "very bad development." Speaking with Sewell Chan from the New York Times, Bernanke shed light on the significant role played by educational disparities in fueling this growing concern. This matter warrants immediate attention by the government and policymakers, as it has detrimental effects on social cohesion, economic growth, and overall stability.

According to Bernanke, the considerable difference in unemployment rates between college graduates and high school graduates points to the formation of two distinct societies within the country. College graduates currently have an unemployment rate of 5%, while high school graduates face a rate of 10% or more. As a result, income and wealth distribution is heavily skewed in favor of those with higher education.

Bernanke argued that this disparity directly contributes to a fragmented and unequal society, negatively impacting social cohesion and creating an environment where mutual understanding and cooperation are difficult. Moreover, the imbalance in wealth distribution often leads to a lack of resources and opportunities for those at the lower end of the economic scale, further exacerbating the issue and hindering social mobility.

The current level of income inequality in America is at its highest since the peak of the roaring 1920s. This alarming statistic warrants a reevaluation of societal priorities and requires policies and measures aimed at reducing the gap in income and wealth distribution. Promoting educational equity and providing opportunities for skill development to people from all backgrounds is a crucial step towards addressing this pressing issue.

In conclusion, the United States is facing an ever-growing problem of wealth and income inequality, which is accentuated by disparities in educational attainment and employment opportunities. It is imperative for the government and policymakers to address this issue by focusing on areas of educational equity, skill development, and support for those sections of the population most affected by this divide. Failure to act could result in a society plagued by instability, lack of social cohesion, and stunted economic growth.
