During the week of spring break, thousands of families are traveling to Galveston Island, and some of these vacationers are in for a big surprise. A pair of fishermen in a boat managed to catch a shark, take its measurements, and then release it a few blocks west of 61st Street. On Wednesday, a mother from Houston who was vacationing with her son in Galveston captured the incident on video using her cell phone. At the beach, we demonstrated to families. "Surprising. It is imperative that you exercise caution and refrain from going all the way outside." Little Jaiden Hill said that her grandfather Bruce Ishem told her that her cousins from Oklahoma asked if there were any sharks where they were staying. "They are from Oklahoma," Ishem said. A lot of families report that they've given it some consideration in the past. According to the beach patrol, this is not an uncommon occurrence. "Indeed, it raises a lot of concerns, ma'am. Due to the fact that we forgot to pack our swimwear, this trip did not include any time spent in the ocean. When we do this again, I think we should be a little bit more careful, "mother Amy Mouton from Cypress shared her thoughts. Chief Peter Davis of the Galveston Island Beach Patrol says that actual bites on visitors to the island are extremely uncommon. Davis stated that there are sharks in the Gulf of Mexico. "If you are in a hurry, you should avoid shuffling your feet when you are in the water; however, if you are not in a hurry, you should shuffle your feet. This causes a vibration that warns baby fish, catfish, and stingrays, as well as anything else you don't want to get mixed up with, and they will move out of your path if they are aware that you are there "said Davis. After taking its measurements, the fishermen released the shark back into the ocean to cheers from onlookers. It was the recommendation of one of the younger beachgoers that we spoke to, and we couldn't agree more. Little Adelei Mouton said, "I would let it be back in because I am an animal lover, and I don't want it to die and it would bite me." "I would let it be back in because I am an animal lover,"
