As Target's stock falls and sales fall in the midst of a boycott over its recently announced pro-transgender bathroom policy, the company's CEO insists that falling sales are due to the weather, not the company's bathroom policy. In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Target CEO Brian Cornell pegged the downturn in the company's fortunes to the cold weather as opposed to anything the company itself is doing or not doing. "It's been a very wet and cold start to the year, and it shows in our sales," Cornell told the newspaper. "From a structural standpoint, we haven't seen anything that gives us pause." In other words, the weather, not Target's "structural" transgender bathroom policy, is to blame for the downturn. Indeed, the Target CEO came out a month after the initial announcement to double down on the transgender agenda, indicating that the company is digging in its heels rather than looking for ways to appeal to customers. Nonetheless, Cornell's weather assessment does not quite match other reports claiming Target has taken a significant hit since announcing its transgender policy. To be sure, most retailers were down in the first and early second quarters of this year. However, Target's decline has outpaced that of its competitors. Target, for example, predicts adjusted earnings per share of $1 to $1.20, well below the $1.38 predicted by analysts. Furthermore, the company's sales are 1.2 percent lower than the 1.5 to 2.5 percent annual target it had hoped to achieve. Target warned that sales may be flat by the end of the second quarter as a result of the drop. A closer look, however, reveals that sales and the company's reputation have taken a particular hit since its April 19 pro-transgender bathroom announcement, which sparked a major boycott movement with 1.2 million supporters in just a week. According to a recent Business Insider article, Target's consumer reputation has dropped six points in the last few months. In the months leading up to the announcement of the bathroom policy, 42 percent of consumers said they would shop at the department store chain. However, in the month following the announcement of the bathroom policy, the figure fell to 36%. According to the reports, consumer perception of the Target brand is at its lowest in two years. Whatever the cause, Target has lost nearly $6 billion in stock value since April 19. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter, or send an email to igcolonel@hotmail.com.
