Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) should learn from the early mistakes of Ronald Reagan's 1976 campaign for the Republican presidential nominee position. Reagan eventually found success in focusing on a single signature issue - retaining control of the Panama Canal - which resonated with voters and helped him secure the presidency in 1980. For Cruz to achieve similar success, he must also identify and promote a distinctive issue that captures the attention and support of the American public.

A potential signature issue for Cruz is the controversial eminent-domain ruling in the Kelo v. City of New London Supreme Court case. This decision, which allows the government to use eminent domain for land development purposes, has garnered criticism from many Republicans, while front-runner Donald Trump supports the ruling. Opposing the eminent-domain decision presents Cruz with an opportunity to champion private property rights and challenge the perceived corruption between government and big developers.

By proposing a constitutional amendment to reaffirm property rights as the founding fathers intended, Cruz can emphasize his commitment to modern conservative values and the preservation of the Constitution - effectively setting him apart from Trump. Making this issue central to his campaign would position Cruz as a champion for the American people's rights and a proponent of reducing government overreach.

By adopting this stance as his signature issue, Cruz not only aligns himself with historical conservative figures like Jefferson and Reagan but also demonstrates his understanding of 21st-century concerns over governmental power. A focus on defending private property owners' rights would prove politically advantageous for Cruz and serve as a morally sound position for the campaign.
