I 
 
 i am a true Bangalorean. I was born in Basavangudi. The beauty of Bangalore is that it allows for simplicity and joy - a cup of coffee and  masala dosa at Vidyarthi Bhavan will make you happy. I don't see this Bangalore anymore. It is now a terrible city. There was more poetry and music here before the computer boom. The city we've created in recent years has rotted - heavily polluted, garbage strewn everywhere, including the intellectual waste dumped into this city by the computer industry. Bangalore has always been a highly intellectual city. Although it is called the garden city, there is more science here than anywhere else in India. These days, no one talks about it. They just call it computer city. When it all started, I thought it was a good thing because a lot of people got jobs. Over the years, it has created a large upper-middle-class population encroaching on commercial centers. There's nothing wrong with that, but what's really bad is its effect on Bangalore's intellectual content. . Smart people at a very young age, even before the age of 20, consider IT as an option because they can make money quickly. Many intelligent people do jobs that are  below their intellectual capacity. They are like salaried people and do not produce quality intellectual material. Can the India of the future afford?
