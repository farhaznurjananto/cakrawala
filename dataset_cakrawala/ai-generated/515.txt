Last week, the latest syndication numbers for Modern Family's freshman run were released, showcasing the Emmy-winning ABC comedy's impressive performance on both the USA network and in broadcast syndication. The show achieved new combined highs in all key measurements, including households (5.1), Adults 18-34 (3.1), and Adults 18-49 (3.1). Modern Family now ranks as the No. 2 program in all of syndication among 18-49, behind The Big Bang Theory (3.4), and takes the No. 1 spot in the 18-34 demographic. 

In addition, the season-to-date rankings for all broadcast programs were released, revealing that Modern Family is averaging a 5.0 in the 18-49 demographic through the first 12 weeks of the season (in the most current ratings, including DVR playback). This places the show in a tie with NBC's The Blacklist for No. 3 in the 18-49 demographic, behind Sunday Night Football (7.9) and Big Bang (6.8). However, in comparison to the same 12 weeks of the previous season, Modern Family is down 21% - this decline occurring despite the show's strong start in syndication.

It usually takes time for shows to establish themselves in syndication, and it is rare for a show to break out immediately, regardless of the rollout promotion. The Big Bang Theory, for example, gradually evolved into the ratings powerhouse it has become for TBS. Normally, by this point in their syndication run, shows should have hit their stride (Modern Family is up 15% from its premiere week in syndication among 18-49 and up 29% in 18-34), and their impact on the show's broadcast run should be felt. Through the first 12 weeks of fall 2011, when Big Bang launched in syndication, it saw a 21% increase season-over-season on CBS. In comparison, Modern Family experienced a 20% drop, a surprising discrepancy considering both comedies were supported by massive marketing campaigns during their syndication launches.

Industry insiders are puzzled, as no one can offer a reasonable explanation for Modern Family's discrepancy. Some suggest that the overall softness of ABC's lineup this season could be a factor; however, this has not prevented Scandal from excelling and posting year-to-year gains. Others point out that ABC lacks a promotional platform like football, which CBS uses to reach a broader audience for Big Bang. However, Fox and NBC also have extensive NFL coverage, and this has not significantly benefited their live-action comedies.

Modern Family concluded its last season down 11% from 2011-12. Similarly, Big Bang saw a dip in ratings in the season before its syndication launch when it moved to a new night, Thursday, and lost the protection of a Two And A Half Men lead-in. However, during the same 2010-11 season, Big Bang expanded its cast with the addition of Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch. This creative shift brought about a newfound dynamic with seven main characters and has contributed to the show's continued ratings growth ever since. Meanwhile, Modern Family, despite remaining solid and holding onto its title as a three-time winner of the Best Comedy Series Emmy, has seemingly lost some of the creative spark it exhibited in its early days.

There is still time for Modern Family to turn its ratings around, as syndication ratings typically peak early in the calendar year, often in February. The show may see some improvement when it returns with new episodes in January, having concluded its fall season on a higher note. This is reminiscent of Big Bang, which reached series highs in the 2013 portion of the previous season â€“ a pattern that was also seen with CBS drama NCIS, another series whose broadcast ratings were boosted by its off-network run.
