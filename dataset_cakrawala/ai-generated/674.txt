A group of Chinese teachers who were brought in to participate in a reality TV show within the British school system found that the British students they encountered were disruptive, rude, and idle. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if these students could adapt to the strict teaching methods utilized in China.

For this experiment, five Chinese teachers taught fifty students aged 13-14 at Bohunt School in Liphook, Hampshire. The rest of the school followed their normal curriculum with their usual teachers for four weeks. The results, which consist of tests in mathematics, science, and Mandarin, will be revealed in the BBC2 documentary "Are Our Kids Tough Enough? Chinese School."

It is important to note that in 2012, the Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) found that Shanghai mathematics results were three years ahead of those in the UK. However, during the experiment, one student was expelled from class after claiming that the teacher was being rude by suggesting that British students were behind those in China.

Yang Jun, a UK-based, China-qualified science teacher who participated in the show, shared his experience when a female student left the class weeping after learning that Zayn Malik had quit One Direction. He stated, "We are learning classroom management skills. In China, we don't need classroom management skills because everyone is disciplined by nature, by families, byâ€¦ society. Whereas here, that is the most challenging part of teaching."

Chinese teaching involves 12-hour school days and is predominantly teacher-led. Shanghai's Pisa scores are the highest in the world, while the UK ranks 26th, 20th, and 23rd in mathematics, science, and reading.

Another teacher from China, Li Aiyun, experienced challenges with students not paying attention, saying, "Some students were chatting, some students were eating, somebody was even putting makeup on her face. I had to control myself, or I would be crazy."

The experiment highlights the cultural differences in teaching methods and student behavior between the two countries. The BBC acknowledged that the program does not claim to be scientific and that the final test results may show a "difference of opinion."
