There is no question that this man is undeniably the most exceptional clean hitter in the history of the Chicago Cubs. However, it is important to note that his singing abilities might not be on par with his unparalleled baseball prowess. Regardless of his vocal talents or lack thereof, Mr. Cub made sure to delight the crowd at Wrigley Field on opening day, confidently proclaiming that "The Cubs will be supreme in 2013" and getting everyone excited with his infectious enthusiasm.

Following his bold prediction, Mr. Cub led the crowd in a slightly off-key yet endearing and spirited rendition of the classic baseball anthem, "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." His energy and dedication truly embodied the essence of the sport and reminded fans of the long-standing tradition of baseball in Chicago.

One cannot help but think of the organist when discussing the atmosphere of the game. This often unsung hero of the baseball world deserves recognition and perhaps even a well-deserved pay increase. Is it possible that the organist is the same individual who had to keep up with Harry Caray's unforgettable performances all those years ago? The answer remains a mystery, but their contribution to the unique Wrigleyville experience is undeniable.

Despite the enjoyable festivities of the day, the home team unfortunately came up short in their efforts, sliding to a disappointing 2-5 loss for the season. It is only natural for fans to critique the Cubs' performance on the field, and rightly so, but their unwavering traditional team spirit remains resilient and beyond reproach.

As we look forward to future opening days and the rollercoaster of emotions they bring, one thing is certain: the unstoppable spirit and optimism of Mr. Cub is an integral part of the Wrigley Field experience. With his iconic call to arms, "Let's Play Two," Mr. Cub never fails to remind us all of the joy and excitement that the game of baseball can bring.
