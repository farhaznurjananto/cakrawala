Carol Nault's cat takes about a cup of dry food a day.

If Carol Nault's cat eats about a cup of dry food a day, she would need to provide her cat with at least one can of wet food per day to ensure that her cat gets the moisture she needs. Without enough moisture in the diet, a cat's skin and coat can become dry and brittle. If your cat is eating a wet food diet, she may also need a water dish and a litter box. If you are not sure how much your cat eats or how often she needs to go to the bathroom, you can check with your veterinarian or a cat food manufacturer. 

If you have a cat that is not eating or drinking enough, you can try providing her with a water dish and a litter box. If your cat is eating and drinking enough, you may not need to provide additional care. If your cat is not eating or drinking enough, you should consult with a veterinarian. Some cats may require medication to help them get enough moisture in their diet.
