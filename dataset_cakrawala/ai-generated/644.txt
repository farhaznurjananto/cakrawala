The RSA recently released a comprehensive report examining the so-called "VOHO" attacks which targeted pro-democracy, military industrial base, and high finance firms. Despite its thorough analysis, the report left one critical question unanswered: who, or what, was behind these sophisticated and widespread attacks? Although the malware used in the recent "watering hole" attacks provides some clues about the origins of the attacks, it is not sufficient to conclusively attribute them to any specific group, country, or actor.

Chris Elisan, a Principal Malware Scientist at RSA and the lead investigator into the malware used in the VOHO attacks, explains that the malware itself is only one part of the puzzle. Other essential components in the "attack chain" are needed to identify the source of the attack as coming from a specific country, known hacking crew, cybercriminal gang, or cyber warfare unit. Along with the malware, one would need information about the command and control (C&C) infrastructure, drop zones (for stolen data), and the malware update servers. It is the combination of these technical elements that allows experts to identify the human element behind the attack; however, this process takes time.

As of now, Elisan says that researchers need more time to gather evidence about the attacks before they can offer any insights on the origin of the cyber-assault. When asked whether there were any indications in the decompiled binaries collected from the attack that suggested the attacks originated in China, as many speculate, or from another country, Elisan admits that even if such indicators are present, they might not be conclusive. For instance, someone could plant Chinese sayings or characters to mislead investigators.

The official RSA report on the water holing or VOHO attacks is also cautious when it comes to drawing conclusions about attribution. The report does not make a direct reference to China but acknowledges that a component of the VOHO attacks, a script dubbed xKungfoos, "likely originated in Asia" where it was used to launch attacks on political dissidents.

An earlier report by security firm Symantec provided a similar assessment of the sophisticated attacks and use of watering hole sites. Symantec attributed the attacks to what it called the "Elderwood Project" or the "Elderwood Platform" but did not provide any definitive information about who owns or operates the so-called Elderwood.

The RSA report notes that the eight-month-old VOHO attacks share several similarities with the Aurora and GhostNet attacks, both attributed directly to the Chinese government. It also points out that the C&C infrastructure was found "in the Hong Kong area." Symantec's report, too, mentions that human rights and religious groups concentrated mainly in China were the second most common target after Western defense industries. However, conclusive attribution of the VOHO attacks to China remains elusive.

Attribution in cyber-attacks is always a difficult matter. Several experts have criticized RSA for the lack of clarity in the VOHO report. For instance, Jeffrey Carr, founder and CEO of TAIA Global, notes that the report seems to assume that China is behind the attacks, merely due to the use of the term "APT", which Carr believes is a poorly kept code word for China. Carr argues that connecting the use of specific scripts or the geographic location of C&C servers with the cyber-attack's origin does not meet the standard of proof required for attribution.

As researchers continue to piece together clues, it is evident that the attacks were not opportunistic or solely criminal in nature. The attackers chose their "watering hole" sites and techniques carefully, targeting enterprises and organizations rather than individuals. While this level of sophistication does point to a potentially geopolitical motivation for the attacks, determining the true origin remains a challenge.

Ultimately, rather than attributing an attack to a specific group or nation, the primary focus should be on the victims and their defenses against such cyber threats. Regardless of the source, better defenses are essential to ensure a more robust and cyber-secure environment. In the end, attribution is only important or relevant for victims if they have the capability and interest in retaliating; what matters most is improving defenses against such attacks, regardless of their origin.
