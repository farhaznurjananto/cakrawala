At a time when Israel is getting ready for a rate decision, various macroeconomic developments are posing significant challenges to its monetary policy. The country's growth rate has dropped sharply from 2.0% in Q1 to 0.3% q/q (saar) in Q2, and this decrease is quite alarming. The situation is compounded by the fact that export volumes are also declining, indicating that the ILS is too strong.

Barclays analyses suggest that the slowdown in the country's growth rate can be attributed to several factors like decline in global trade and a fall in consumption growth. While the country's growth figures are subject to revisions and other monthly indicators still indicate steady growth, the 2015 and 2016 growth are expected to be at 2.3%, down from 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively.

The growth slowdown has put more pressure on the Bank of Israel (BoI) to loosen its monetary policies. At the same time, inflation is below zero (-0.3% y/y in July), and inflation expectations continue to slide. Currently, the BoI has little room to manoeuvre with its policy rates already quite low at 0.1%. It is also wary of introducing negative rates.

To counter the problem, the BoI has intervened and purchased USD5bn this year unsterilized in an attempt to weaken the ILS and expand the money supply. Despite this effort, however, the ILS appreciated even further, prompting the BoI and Ministry of Finance to intervene aggressively and weaken the currency.

Barclays believes that the BoI will stay on hold and closely monitor what the US Fed does in September. The current weakness of the ILS gives the BoI the leeway to take this action. Pressure is building up on the bank to find a way to loosen current monetary conditions.
