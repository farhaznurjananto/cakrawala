The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, has been criticised for his handling of the military following his announcement that he had asked the Chief of Defence Staff to work with allies to create plans for a military no-fly zone over Libya. The government has received criticism for its clumsy approach to the rescue of British citizens, as well as its reported lack of military capability caused by the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) last year.

While the previous Labour government left the current UK government with a £38 billion deficit in the defence budget, the general consensus is that the review, which was conducted by inexperienced ministers and the newly established National Security Council, failed to address the needs of the country for future – possibly larger - threats. Furthermore, the review does not appear to have taken into account the country's most important ally – the United States, despite plans to maintain the UK's role as the US's closest ally.

In response to recent events in Libya, Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute has accused the government of failing to capitalise on Britain's "strategic moment." Furthermore, fifteen retired commanders and military scholars have urged the government to reconsider the SDSR’s maritime component, claiming that the decision to scrap the entire fleet of Harrier jump jets and HMS Ark Royal, the navy's only active aircraft-carrier, represents a risky bet that Britain will not need any carrier strike capability for a decade, “in an uncertain, fast-moving and dangerous world”. The recent call for a Libyan no-fly zone further supports their argument that a carrier would be useful in enforcing one.

While the government has claimed that the SDSR will not be revisited, following criticism by military experts and Conservative MPs, Mr Cameron and his Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, may have to reconsider their approach to defence strategy. The ongoing turmoil in Libya, along with the possibility of further instability in the oil-producing Gulf, highlights the urgency of the UK's need for a strategic and coherent defence plan that will not only address threats from counter-insurgencies, but also address future and more significant threats.
