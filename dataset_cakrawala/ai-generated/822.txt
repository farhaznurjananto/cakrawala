2009-07-09, 4:45 The third test's concluding moments were marred by controversy, but who ultimately had a say in the pivotal choice that had players and commentators baffled? Minute 78. 15-15. Penalty Blacks all. Both the game and the series are on the line. Now comes inspector Poite and Jrme Garcs, his dependable companion. Poite has the last say, but as the video below demonstrates, his first judgment was overruled after consulting with the TMO and was awarded an All Black penalty after a little trip back. Whatever your opinion of the call, it's intriguing that Poite seems to have been persuaded by a brief conversation with the linesman who was standing on the incorrect side of the ground. Mr. Garcs. After in-depth discussion with his TMO, Poite decides that penalizing Owens for unintentional offside is the proper course of action. Right or wrong, he has come to the conclusion that the Lions should be given a penalty that might decide the game. He starts to explain the choice to Read and Warburton when Garces' headset interrupts him. I think the phrase "Oui Jerome?" roughly translates to "Yeah Jerome?" The brief chat, which we are unable to hear, is one-sided. The intervention results in Poite's initial decision to impose a punishment being overturned. What was said by Garces, and why did it affect Poite's choice? Read and the pundits are perplexed by the "bargain," as Poite puts it, but Warburton appears relieved as he signals for a scrum. There is a case to be made that Read was offside at the kickoff or impeded Williams in the air, and everyone will have their own judgment. They are unimportant. What did Garces say to Poite and why did it affect his decision? That is the query I would love to have answered.
