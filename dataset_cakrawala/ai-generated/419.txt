Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) is a contagious horse virus that is spreading throughout Central Texas. At least eight new cases have been confirmed in Bastrop and Travis County, leading to quarantines, canceled shows, and economic losses. To prevent further spread of this painful disease, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) recommends keeping the fly population down and watching for symptoms such as lesions and sloughing of the skin from the hooves to the muzzle affecting the mouth and tongue.

The transmission rate of VS is high, with flies being a known transmitter of the virus. Due to its contagious nature and potential economic impact, ranch owners and trainers are taking the necessary precautions to prevent their horses from getting infected. Beverly Manroe, a trainer from North Austin, emphasizes that a facility quarantine could lead to significant economic losses. Three horses were unable to compete in her show at the Travis County Expo Center last week due to VS.

VS may not be a severe illness for horses, but some types of the virus may cause flu-like symptoms in humans. Therefore, it is essential to be careful and take preventive measures to control the spread of the disease. Since May 28, TAHC has quarantined at least 21 locations in eight Texas counties due to VS. Rusty Edwards, a ranch owner from Bastrop, says he's not taking any chances and closed his place down to protect his 45 horses from being infected.

In conclusion, VS is a highly contagious horse virus that is affecting ranch owners and horse trainers in Central Texas. The best thing that can be done is to control the fly population and be alert for any symptoms in horses. Taking preventive measures will help prevent the virus from spreading and making more horses sick.
