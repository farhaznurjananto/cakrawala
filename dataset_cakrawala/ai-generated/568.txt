A Detroit city attorney warned a federal judge that Detroit may not survive as a major city if its debt is not significantly reduced during the bankruptcy process. The statement was made at the start of a critical phase of the case, which aims to adjust $18 billion of debt with a 1,034-page plan.

The attorney, Bruce Bennett, stated that the plan's goal is to reduce Detroit's debt by about $7 billion and reinvest up to $1.7 billion in the city. The confirmation hearing to determine if the city's plan to exit bankruptcy is fair and feasible is scheduled to continue until mid-October.

Detroit has successfully settled with most of its major creditors, but two insurance companies - Syncora Guarantee Inc and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co - have emerged as major objectors to the plan. These companies had guaranteed payments on $1.4 billion of pension debt that the city is trying to void.

A proposed "grand bargain" would tap into funding from foundations and the Detroit Institute of Arts, as well as a $195 million lump sum payment from the Michigan government. The money would be used to alleviate pension cuts for city retirees and prevent the museum's collection from being sold to pay creditors.

The city attorney argued that hold-out unsecured creditors have no grounds under Michigan or federal bankruptcy law to push the city to sell or monetize the art, which is valued at $8 billion. He also stated that raising taxes was not an option, as it could send Detroit further into a downward spiral.

The outcome of the hearing will greatly impact Detroit's future, with Judge Steven Rhodes having the power to either impose terms on hold-out creditors, known as a "cram-down," or not confirm the plan at all.
