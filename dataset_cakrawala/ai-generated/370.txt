Sushi lovers in the East Bay have something to look forward to with the latest concept from AS B-Dama chef-owner Chikara Ono. Delage, located in a petite space adjacent to Old Oakland's Swan Marketplace, is softly opening tonight, Wednesday, through Friday (5:30-9 p.m.), and running the show, initially, is Masa Sasaki, who earned a Michelin star at San Francisco's Maruya. Sasaki will be at the helm for the first few months to get the place up and running.

During the soft opening, the restaurant (which seats around 20 combined between the bar and dining area) will be offering omakase-style service, the Japanese equivalent of Western tasting menus. According to the East Bay Express, a typical dinner might consist of four or five small appetizers and eight or ten pieces of sushi, with prices ranging from $40-60 per person.

The grand opening of Delage is set for sometime in May, so mark your calendars! Delage is located at 536 9th Street, Oakland.
