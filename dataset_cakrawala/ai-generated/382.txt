Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has criticized Hillary Clinton stating that if she wins the presidency, she will push the United States towards endless, foolish wars that only encourage terrorism. Fearing her capabilities, Assange advises US voters not to support her candidacy.

Assange has had plenty of experience with the former secretary of state, having read thousands of her cables. He believes that Clinton's personality, combined with her imprudent policy maneuvers, have directly contributed to the rise of the violent extremist group ISIS. Under Clinton's leadership, Libya in 2011 experienced chaos and confusion after the US and its allies launched an attack to overthrow the nation's leader, Muammar Gaddafi.Â 

During the chaos, hundreds of tons of weapons ended up in the hands of terrorists in Syria, and tens of thousands of lives were lost, regressing women's rights "by hundreds of years." Pentagon generals objected to Clinton's involvement in a war with Libya, fearing her inability to execute a "safe post-war plan." The result proved disastrous.

Assange described Hillary Clinton as a "war hawk" with terrible judgment, who gets an emotional high from killing people. With Sanders gaining in popularity over Clinton in the primaries, consistently leading in polls by double digits, Assange warns US citizens that Clinton ought to be kept far from the White House.

He concludes stating, "she shouldn't be let near a gun shop, let alone an army. And she certainly should not become president of the United States."
