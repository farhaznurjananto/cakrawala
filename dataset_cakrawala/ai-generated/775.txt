In both civil and criminal cases, there are rules about how witnesses can be questioned and how they can be questioned by the other side. The difference between how civil and criminal cases are judged and talked about. How the people in the Sanhedrin sat down. how many people were needed to take notes. How and from whom judges were added if needed. How witnesses in a criminal case should be scared. Why Adam the first was made as a single person. MISHNA I.: Cases that come before the court, whether they are civil or criminal, must have their witnesses examined and looked into. As it says in [Lev. iv. 22], "You shall have only one kind of judicial law." But what's the difference between a civil case and a criminal one? It's as follows: (a) Three judges will hear the first set of cases, and twenty-three judges will hear the second set. b) In the first, the discussion can start with either the accusation or the defense, but in the second, the discussion must start with the defense and not with the accusation. c) In the first case, one voice is enough to either accuse or clear the person. In the second case, one voice is enough to clear the person, but two voices are needed to convict. d) In the first case, a judge who says his opinion will help or hurt the case can, after thinking about it, change his mind and say the opposite. In the second case, however, he can only do this to clear the person, not to punish them. e) In civil cases, the whole court can defend or accuse, but in criminal cases, only some of the judges can defend or accuse. (f) The first can be talked about during the day and the decision made at night, while the second must be made during the day. But if they can't figure it out on the same day, they have to put it off until the next day. (g) In the first case, a decision can be made on the same day, either in the person's favor or against him. In the second case, a decision can be made on the same day to set the person free, but not to sentence him until the next day. Because of this, cases involving the death penalty should not be started on the day before the Sabbath or a legal holiday. In civil cases about defilement and purity, they start by asking the oldest person's opinion. In criminal cases, they start by asking the people sitting on the side. Everyone can be a judge in civil cases, but not everyone can be a judge in criminal cases. Only priests, Levites, and Israelites who can legally marry daughters of priests can be judges in criminal cases. GEMARA: Do civil cases really need an investigation and an examination? If that's the case, the following doesn't make sense. Tosephta: On a document, the date says that it was made on the first of Nissan in a Sabbatical year. When witnesses came, they asked, "How can you testify in favor of this document? Were you not with us on that date in that place?" Both the document and the people who signed it are valid, since it is likely that they wrote the document after the date on it. So, if investigation and examination are necessary, why should the above reason make them valid? Wouldn't the investigation show whether or not that was true? But if you believe this theory, how do you explain the following? Mishna: promissory notes written before a certain date are no longer valid. If they were written later, though, then they are. Now, if a civil case needs to be looked into, why should what was written later still be valid? (The investigation would show that the witnesses who signed the document were not there when the loan was given because the document had been signed earlier. So the loan made earlier should be thought of as a verbal loan, which doesn't collect from encumbered estates, and the note should be thought of as a fake?) This is not a problem. The objection was more about what the Boraitha said, because it talks about a Sabbatical year, which is a year when people don't usually lend money because of the law [Deut. xv.2], but it still makes what was written in the month of Nissan valid, because the law about promissory notes only applies at the end of the year. But the contradiction with our Mishna still stands! R. Hanina said that, according to the Bible, there is no difference between civil and criminal cases when it comes to investigations, because it says "One way of judicial law" and other things. But why was it decided that investigations do not have to be done in civil cases? So as not to turn people away who want to borrow. (And our Mishna, which says it's needed, was taught before the law was passed, while the Boraitha was used after the law was passed.) But if that's the case, why should the judge who made a mistake in the case not be held accountable? If this were to happen
