Thermal imaging is a technique that captures the thermal energy emitted by objects or people. It's an incredibly useful tool in many areas, from medicine to engineering, but it's also a fascinating way to explore the world around us. This is where a new project comes in, promising to capture and share images of everyday objects and scenarios in all their thermal glory.

The creator of this project is a skilled photographer who is passionate about thermal imaging. He promises to create stunning images of everyday objects, with a thermal resolution of 320x240px. This will provide a fascinating glimpse into the different levels of heat that objects emit, allowing us to see the world in a completely new way.

To make the images even more spectacular, the project creator has pledged to add a range of effects to each image. Backers of the project will receive four images per object, in two different color palettes, for a total of eight images per object. The objects photographed will be heated up with normal light, light without IR-light, IR-light only, and even microwaved. The resulting images will be a vibrant and fascinating insight into the world of thermal imaging.

While the project creator is keen to experiment with different objects, he has pledged not to subject any cats or laptops to these effects! Instead, he will focus on everyday items such as coffee cups, books, and household objects. The project aims to capture the heat radiating from these objects, highlighting the complex thermal signatures that they emit.

If this exciting project reaches its fundraising goals, backers can look forward to a fascinating range of thermal images. The project creator also plans to start a blog, sharing thermal images of everyday things and sceneries. This promises to be a rich and diverse collection of images, providing an entirely new perspective on the world around us.

Overall, this project is an exciting and inventive way to explore the world of thermal imaging. With its promise of stunning images and an entirely new viewpoint on everyday objects, it's a project worth supporting. If you're interested in photography, science, or just curious about the world around you, this is a fascinating opportunity to see it in a whole new way.
