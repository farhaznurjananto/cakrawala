Men Will Avoid Sex Because of Fear of Impotence, Survey Says

U.S. News & World Reportâ€”June 30, 2016

A new survey finds that nearly one in five men fear they will suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED), and says this will cause them to avoid sex. The survey, conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Chicago-based Androderm, found that 18 percent of men say ED would cause them to avoid sex.

The survey also found that only 28 percent of men would feel comfortable talking to their healthcare provider about ED.

"We've seen a lot of research over the years that has shown that erectile dysfunction can have a tremendous impact on a man's self-esteem and his relationship with his partner," said S. Bradley Aouizerat, M.D., a staff urologist at HSS. "It can cause tremendous anxiety and stress in men, and often leads to depression."

"One of the things that's important for physicians to remember is that many men are uncomfortable talking about erectile dysfunction," explained Dr. Aouizerat. "It's a very sensitive topic for many men, and it's important for physicians to approach the conversation in a sensitive way."

The survey also found that other factors that can lead to men avoiding sex include feeling tired (25 percent), not being attracted to their partner (23 percent), and not being able to have an orgasm (22 percent).

"It's crucial that men receive the appropriate help and treatment for erectile dysfunction, and that they feel comfortable talking to their healthcare provider about the issue," said Dr. Aouizerat. "There are a variety of treatments available that can help men improve their sex lives."

The survey was conducted online from May 24-30, 2016, among a nationwide sample of 1,000 U.S. men ages 18 and over. The margin of error for the complete survey is +/- 3.1 percentage points.
