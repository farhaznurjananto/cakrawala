Star Citizen, the upcoming space simulator, has developed a system called "Grabby Hands" that allows for realistic interaction with in-game objects of various sizes. This is a big part of the game, which involves hauling items ranging from handheld weapons to massive spacecraft components. The system is designed to be precise enough to simulate coin-flips and manipulate firearms, creating new ways for players to express themselves through their interactions in the game.

Instead of creating unique animations for every object, Cloud Imperium developed the Grabby Hands system to allow for maximum interaction directly with in-game objects. Interactions with cargo will be managed through an onboard manifest used to activate and deactivate locking plates, which will arrange cargo order and track how the cargo's mass and volume is impacting the ship's performance.

According to the developers, container and pallet operations will be used to load bulk cargo, while cargo holds will use "locking plates" to keep everything secure. These plates only require power to change state and will secure even unboxed cargo as long as it is fully within the locking area. This means that only cargo containers can stack, disallowing infinite bridges, and turning off the power plant won't shred the ship with instant cargo shrapnel.

While loading crates onto an intergalactic Mack truck may not be the sexiest feature of a space simulator, it does point to an impressive level of fidelity. The various systems in action can be viewed on the Roberts Space Industries website. Despite the challenges associated with making cargo sexy, Star Citizen is putting a lot of effort into creating a system that allows maximum interaction directly with in-game objects, ensuring players have the most immersive and engaging experience.
