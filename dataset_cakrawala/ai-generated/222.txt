P. Sathasivam, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of India, will retire on April 26, after having served for only nine months. Despite his relatively brief term in office, he has presided over several landmark cases and administrative decisions that will shape the country for years to come.

Even before becoming chief justice in July, Sathasivam was known for his judgments. In 2010, he sent a notice to Delhi University concerning its decision to withdraw AK Ramanujan’s essay “300 Ramayanas” from its BA syllabus. In 2013, he was on a panel that upheld the conviction of four accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom.

In January, Sathasivam became notable for commuting the death sentences of 11 convicts on the basis that delaying the review of their mercy petitions for years after they had been sentenced amounted to torture. In February, he overturned the death penalty for Rajiv Gandhi’s assassins, citing his previous judgment and once again noting the inordinate delay in deciding the mercy petition. At the end of March, he commuted the death penalty of Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar to life.

Sathasivam’s judgments on the issue of mercy petitions and capital punishment establish that delaying such decisions can be viewed as sufficient grounds for commuting the penalty. This is a significant step in a country that is hesitant to consider a moratorium on the death penalty.

Sathasivam influenced politics as well, forcing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to acknowledge his matrimonial status. In response to a petition filed by a non-governmental organization, Resurgent India, the chief justice ruled that returning officers could reject incomplete nomination forms, since voters had a right to know everything relevant about candidates.

Sathasivam championed judicial reform as well, clearing many pending cases and streamlining the judicial system. He created a special bench in August 2013 to clear cases related to constitutional queries, and another for women and children. By setting up a bench in October, he was able to clear a large number of mercy petitions in January. In November, he supported the National Lok Adalat, which cleared over 35 lakh (3.5 million) pending cases in a single day.

Finally, Sathasivam demonstrated a commitment to social justice by awarding compensation to the families of manual scavengers who had died in sewers since 1993. He also spoke about the need for basic reservations in the judiciary, adding that the collegium should consider these factors when appointing judges.

In conclusion, P. Sathasivam’s tenure as chief justice of the Supreme Court of India may have been brief, but his judgments and administrative decisions have significance that will last for years to come.
