Japan is planning to convert the 248-metre long Izumo helicopter carrier into a fighter jet carrier. If successful, it will be the first Japanese vessel capable of launching warplanes since the Second World War, further reflecting Japan's recent shift towards militarisation. This shift has sparked warnings from China, as it appears that Japan may be moving away from the peace agreement signed after the Second World War that promised to transform its military into a defensive force.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying urged Japan to engage in actions that enhance mutual trust and promote regional peace and stability. China has warned that this move may violate Japan's constitutional "no-war" clause. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already faced criticism for signing arms deals, including a deal with the US to purchase 42 F-35A planes.

While the F-35A requires a runway and would be unsuitable for a converted Izumo-class carrier, it has been suggested that the order could be revised to include F-35Bs with vertical take-off capabilities. Local media has estimated the cost of conversion at £372 million ($500 million), with the figure potentially increasing to £3 billion ($4 billion) if another similar ship, the Kaga, was added. It is anticipated that the carrier would patrol disputed areas of the East China Sea, where China and Japan both claim sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands.

This development comes in the wake of Japan's construction of missile batteries on an island near China. The military expansion will also see the installation of anti-ship and anti-aircraft cruise missile batteries, troop garrisons, and radar installations on Japanese islands. This fortification comes at a time when Beijing is aggressively working to extend its power in the South China Sea, aiming to take control of shipping lanes and islands from other nations.

Both China and Japan are currently locked in a dispute over the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands.
