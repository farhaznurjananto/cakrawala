Hi all, Our Model 3 get-together will be this Sunday, October 15, from 11 a.m. to noon. The address is 12791 Sorrento Valley Rd, San Diego, CA 92121. This is the Sorrento Valley/Carmel Valley Park and Ride. It's a big parking lot in the middle of the city, not too far to the east (because it's going to be HOT! ), close to a lot of major freeways, and, hopefully, mostly empty on the weekend. I hope many of you will be there! Click to show more...
