The Scottish Covenanters, a passionate and dedicated group of Christians, faced some of the most intense trials in the history of the Church. Their unwavering faith and commitment to Christ were forged in the fires of tribulation, making their sermons, teachings, and commentaries all the more precious and valuable to modern-day believers. In their adversity, the Covenanters were able to draw closer to God and produce profound and enduring works of theology and faith. This collection of writings invites the reader to explore the Covenantersâ€™ insights and wisdom, which are just as relevant and powerful today as they were centuries ago.

Experiencing Christ in Trials

The Scottish Covenanters faced immense adversity and persecution, yet their faith remained strong and unwavering. Their writings provide powerful examples of how believers can not only endure suffering but continue to grow in their faith despite it.

Christ at the Center

At the heart of the Scottish Covenanters' faith was their devotion and love for Jesus Christ. John Brown of Wamphray's "The Way, the Truth, and the Life" and Robert Rollock's exposition on Christ's Life exemplify this love and devotion, which remains a powerful call towards deeper personal faithfulness.

Discovering the Depths of God's Love

The Scottish Covenanters wrote extensively about the depths of Christ's love and His desire to draw sinners to Himself. This is evidenced in James Durham's "Christ Crucified" and William Guild's "Meditations on the Death of Christ." These works invite readers to immerse themselves in the love of Christ, transforming their lives and deepening their relationship with God.

Assurance of Salvation

One of the primary concerns of the Scottish Covenanters was the assurance of salvation for genuine believers. Works such as William Guthrie's "The Christian's Great Interest" and John Forbes' letter on assurance explain how believers can find the confidence that they belong to Christ and are destined for eternal life.
