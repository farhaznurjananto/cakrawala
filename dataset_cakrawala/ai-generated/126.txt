By Eric Beinhocker Economic ideas matter. They shape whether and how we invest in public goods like education, infrastructure, and research and development. They determine tax rates and the size of government. They influence whether we prioritize fighting poverty or reducing inequality. We are in the midst of an epic battle of ideas over the proper role of government. Conservatives have argued for decades that government is the problem, while liberals have argued that government is the solution. But this dichotomy is a false choice. Government is not the enemy of the free market, nor is it its saviour. The truth is that the free market cannot exist without government. The fundamental role of government is to establish and enforce the rules of the market game. This is the rule of law, which protects property rights, enforces contracts, and provides essential public goods and services like courts, police, and national defence. Free markets are also built on trust, which is why much of what we value about modern capitalism was established by trust-building institutions like churches and charities, not by government. The free markets also require a level playing field. History shows that the most successful societies have what economists call “inclusive institutions”—institutions that distribute power and wealth broadly. The best-performing economies in the world have strong social safety nets, like Canada’s Medicare and Sweden’s social security system, which provide basic health care and retirement income to their citizens. Inclusive institutions are the foundation of a strong economy, and they are essential for creating a fair society.
