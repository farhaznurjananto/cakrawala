Mark Roth, a biochemist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, has advanced a suspended animation technique that could improve the chances of saving trauma patients and extend the shelf life of transplant organs. Inspired by hibernation processes, the technique involves suffocating the wounded before refrigerating them. Roth has been working in suspended animation for years now and made significant progress. He managed to reanimate rats suffering from massive blood loss in 2005 with the support of Pentagon far-out research arm Darpa. He did this by knocking them out and reducing their oxygen consumption using hydrogen sulfide.

According to Danger Room, Mark Roth has progressed to a new related method that could improve trauma survival more effectively. Roth wanted to understand the relationship between two features: getting really cold and using very little oxygen, which a lot of animals do during winter as they hibernate. By studying the life processes of brewer's yeast and nematode worm embryos, Roth and his team concluded that "a coordination of life processes," reacting in sync helped keep the organism alive after their oxygen consumption was reduced, and temperatures were lowered. In his tests, 97 percent of nematodes and 66 percent of yeast outlasted the cold exposure and were good as new once reheated and exposed to oxygen.

However, the team doesn't have the precise knowledge of how the process precisely works. Roth said: "Certain sub-cellular processes are going on but really shouldnâ€™t be". Roth's Darpa-funded research might come in handy as he works out the kinks in this new procedure. Since hydrogen sulfide reduces an organism's consumption of oxygen, it might be the compound to use prior to putting people or organs, into the deep freeze.

The potential benefits of Roth's approach are extensive. By successfully developing this method, it could buy time for trauma patients, including heart attack victims and those suffering massive blood loss, aiding faster medical treatment. Additionally, the Pentagon can keep injured troops alive through the use of the suspended animation technique effectively.

Furthermore, this could help doctors make the most of therapeutic hypothermia, a process that involves cooling down patients to improve their odds of survival and prevent organ damage. Roth predicts that a drug that combines the correct sequence of oxygen deprivation and hypothermia could be developed without dangerous side effects that might accompany the procedure.

Ultimately, Mark Roth's research could save lives and revolutionize organ transplant surgeries. It could offer a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between life and death and allow us to improve our ability to save lives by developing innovative medical procedures.
