The comic book series "We Stand on Guard #1" welcomes readers into a future where war has ravaged the North American continent. In this fictional future of the year 2124, the United States and Canada have been at war for twelve years, with the story primarily focusing on Canada's battle to defend itself. The exact reason for the conflict is unknown, with the narrative instead starting with the aftermath - a Canadian family left decimated, with only their young children surviving.

The first issue follows Amber, one of the orphans, as she hunts wildlife in the Northwest Territories, interrupted by a canine machine that resembles BigDog, a civilian robot developed by Boston Dynamics. A group of civilians on patrol saves Amber from the machine. A dialogue then takes place, implying that America is the aggressor, expanding northward with hostile intentions.

One of the comic's highlights is the artwork by Steve Skroce, who previously collaborated with Brian K. Vaughan on "We Stand on Guard." Skroce's art offers a detailed depiction of technology and weaponry, portraying a future that is recognizable yet quite advanced. The already gaping border between America and Canada has become a warzone, with fences and political drama nowhere to be found, offering a wholly different portrayal of an important geographical point of interest.

Vaughan is known for his engaging characters and dialogue-heavy scripts, but while "We Stand on Guard" promises to be a character-driven story, it does not quite capture the same energy as his previous works, such as "Yorick" from "The Last Man" or "Alana" from "Saga." Amber, while relatable, still needs more character development to make her stand out.

The first issue devotes its focus to introducing a large ensemble of characters, which may be overwhelming for some readers. Nonetheless, its framing of Canada as the underdog in a bloody conflict with the US sets the stage for future issues. Vaughan's previous works are a testament to his ability to create intricate and well-thought-out stories. As such, "We Stand on Guard #1" may not be his strongest first issue, but it undoubtedly holds the promise of future intriguing and exciting stories.
