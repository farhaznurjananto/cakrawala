Atlanta will soon join list of cities where recreational marijuana is legal.

Voters in Atlanta approved a measure that would decriminalize marijuana possession in the city.

The measure was approved by over 82 percent of voters.

The measure would make it legal for people 21 and up to possess one ounce of marijuana or less in the city of Atlanta.

The measure would also create a city-wide task force to study the impact of the measure.

The measure will go into effect on January 1, 2018.
