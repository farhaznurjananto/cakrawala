A recent poll indicates that approximately 56% of Facebook users who are aware of the platform's recent changes hold a negative view of the modifications. USA Today and Gallup conducted a telephone survey involving 2,000 participants and discovered that 26% of daily users report being "very concerned" about privacy, a sentiment shared by only 35% of those who use the site on a weekly basis. This concern is substantial, particularly in the context of Facebook's new Timeline feature that enables users to share their personal history on the platform, ultimately providing more targeted data for advertisers. The implementation timeline for the Timeline feature has yet to be announced.

The survey results suggest that the changes are more evident to daily users as opposed to the general public. Only 34% of respondents were aware of the changes, while 87% of daily users reported awareness. Among those who were informed of the modifications, 56% expressed their disapproval, and 36% welcomed the changes. These results are consistent with a separate study conducted by Mashable on September 30, featuring 3,200 users, in which about 59% stated they had no interest in completing their Timelines.

In conclusion, the surveyed data implies that although Facebook is deeply ingrained in millions of people's lives, a significant portion of users still opts to maintain a level of detachment from the platform's intricacies.
