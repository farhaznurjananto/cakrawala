 Modi 
 
  USB cable is not included. Luckily, I have an Aune T1 DAC that comes with a good B-to-USB cable. Build quality is  the same as Magni. On the back, there are only standard RCA outputs and  USB inputs. Surprisingly, my trusty Aune T1 sounds almost identical to the Schiit Magni and Modi Combo. I'm serious. 95% identical, build quality and size. The only difference is the T1's tube twist option and  can be used as  a DAC or a powerful 1-watt amp, sometimes as a track that pushes the T1 further than the Modi. Tracks like Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean." The T1 has noticeably more front hi-hats. Modi sounds more solid and intimate than Aune, and noticeably less expansive. The T1 is more airy and slightly wider and higher in the soundstage. 
 I consider the Modi  one of the best DACs I've seen at any price point. I'd rate the DAC  as great, very responsive to low EQ, and smooth mids and highs. Typically in the sub-$99 world, USB DACs  have a sharp top region that bounces when loaded at low frequencies and  is out of control. Modi rides like a champ. I have nothing to complain about. It's a simple design that gets the job done and does it  very well. Overall impression of the HE-500 and most other known headphones
