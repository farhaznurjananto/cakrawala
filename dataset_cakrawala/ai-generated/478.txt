A senior doctor at Jayanagar Government Hospital in Bengaluru has found herself in hot water for allegedly aiding three arrested Pakistani nationals in obtaining Aadhaar identification cards. An FIR has now been registered against Dr. CS Nagalakshmamma, a gazetted officer who allegedly verified the documents for the Pakistani nationals without confirming their legitimacy.

The investigation into how the foreign nationals acquired Indian documents such as Aadhaar cards and voter IDs began after their arrest alongside a man from Kerala. The Kerala man, Mohanmmed Sihab, informed the police that with the help of a gazetted officer, he obtained Aadhaar cards for the Pakistani nationals, including his lover.

Dr. Nagalakshmamma verified the documents provided by Sihab despite the questionable nature of their origins. She claims that she didn't hesitate when Sihab approached her, as she has helped many others in the same way, and did not receive any money in return for her actions.

Following the registration of the FIR against Nagalakshmamma, UID Bengaluru Regional Deputy Director Ashok Lenin filed a complaint against her as "Accused no 1" for her role in providing the Aadhaars. Utilizing the documents verified by Dr. Nagalakshmamma, Sihab then proceeded to obtain Aadhaar cards for his partner, Samira Abdul Rehman, and her relatives Khasif Shamsuddin and Kiran Ghulam Ali at a new Aadhaar center.

As the investigation continues, police are considering booking those responsible at the Aadhaar center for negligence. Furthermore, they are examining Sihab's emails to determine any potential links to terrorist organizations. At present, no connections have been established. The accused individuals, who were living illegally and entered India with the assistance of Sihab, have each paid Rs 100 to acquire Aadhaar cards and other documents to pose as Indian nationals. They are currently in jail.
