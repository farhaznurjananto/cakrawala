The strong growth in YouTube's core user base represents enormous opportunities for businesses to reach a broad audience with video. YouTubeâ€™s ad-based revenue model enables individuals and organizations to monetize their content, a feature that has led to many successful careers being launched on the platform. With this feature, YouTube users can earn great returns on their investment in quality video production.

In conclusion, YouTube's milestone comes as a testament to the platform's relative strength in video-sharing services.
