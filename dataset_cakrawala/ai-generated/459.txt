Anthem, as a live service game, is designed to continuously evolve through various tweaks and modifications to keep the gaming experience fresh and engaging for its player base. In the upcoming weeks, the game will undergo a significant update involving the introduction of "vanity chests." While a specific release date is yet to be announced, these new chests will present an exciting addition to Anthem, containing exclusively vanity or aesthetic items that cater to the stylistic preferences of players and allowing for further customization of their gaming experience.

Details about the highly anticipated vanity chests were unveiled during a recent Anthem livestream, shedding light on how they will be integrated into the game's landscape. To access these chests, players will be required to complete stronghold missions, which are known for their challenging and intense encounters. Each stronghold will house four chests that necessitate the use of a key for unlocking. All party members involved in the stronghold can acquire keys, providing a fair opportunity for each player to open one of the chests.

While the exact contents of these chests remain to be disclosed, some information about the variety of items included has been confirmed. Players can expect to find emotes and vinyls, which will enable them to further personalize their Javelin suits and showcase their individual style. Crafting items were mentioned as potential inclusions in the chests, however, the presence of armor remains unconfirmed.

A particularly enticing feature of the vanity chests is the absence of duplicate items, ensuring all the approximately 100 unique items in the chests are new acquisitions for the players. Moreover, these chests have been designed with a community-oriented approach, as each unlocked chest offers loot for all party members involved in completing the stronghold.

While the exact arrival date of these innovative vanity chests in Anthem has yet to be determined, their open discussion during the livestream suggests that they could be implemented as early as the next update. Anthem has already made its debut on some platforms, including PC and Xbox One, and has recently been released on PlayStation 4. Though the game experienced a challenging launch in early access, marked with technical issues and mixed reviews, the fresh addition of vanity chests promises to enhance the gaming experience for all its users.
