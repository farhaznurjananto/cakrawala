Two months after signing a non-funded Space Act Agreement (SAA) with NASA, Bigelow Aerospace has made significant progress in identifying new ideas for private-public partnerships for human space exploration of the solar system. These discussions complement NASA’s near- and long-term exploration goals alongside the private sector’s growing development of exploration facilities for Earth orbit and beyond.

The recent announcement of the Space Act Agreement between NASA and Bigelow Aerospace signifies a growing collaboration between the agency and the commercial sector. It also offers a glimpse into how NASA’s vision of Beyond Earth Orbit (BEO) exploration might evolve based on input from external industries. NASA's William Gerstenmaier, Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, stated that the purpose of this SAA is to survey the aerospace industry to determine their exploration interests.

The agreement consists of two gates. Gate 1 involves Bigelow identifying assets that demonstrate the value of new NASA – and private sector-supported capabilities. This would see Bigelow Aerospace identify key areas such as which companies could make contributions, what contributions could they make, what conditions would be needed to generate these contributions, and when the contributions could be made. Gate 2 involves identifying and establishing mission proposals based on the companies’ stated contributions identified in Gate 1 and their stated mission and exploration interests. The two-stage SAA first identifies interested parties and their potential contributions, and then determines viable mission and exploration goals based on those capabilities.

The timeframe for Bigelow Aerospace to produce the Gates 1 and 2 reports is fairly short, with the final Gate 1 report due on 5 July 2013 and the Gate 2 report to be submitted no later than 2 November 2013. These reports will be released to the general public by NASA upon completion.

In the May 23rd teleconference, Robert T. Bigelow, president and founder of Bigelow Aerospace, presented a draft of the Gate 1 report, which contains an examination of past spaceflight accomplishments and lays out future operations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Lagrangian Point missions to cis-lunar missions. The report aims to identify how the commercial sector can build on what has been accomplished and derive benefits for NASA.

Around 20 companies, including SpaceX, Boeing, SNC (Sierra Nevada Corporation), and Orbitech Technologies Corporation, participated in Gate 1. According to Bigelow, the nature of the Gate 1 report is, in part, a collection of information on what private-sector companies are already doing and how NASA can benefit from their ongoing investment in certain areas of hardware and missions without having to bear the heavy burden of research and development costs.

Bigelow also discussed the potential use of his company's next-generation space station, Alpha Station, by NASA in the coming years, which could provide the agency with more cost-effective mission options.
