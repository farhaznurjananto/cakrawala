Two men have been arrested and charged with the brutal murder of two women and two children in their New York apartment. Justin Mann, 24, and James White, 38, were arraigned in Troy City Court on Saturday and now face several counts of murder. Both men were reportedly acquainted with the victims, and authorities believe the crime was not a random act of violence.

Shanta Myers, 36, and her girlfriend Brandi Mells, 22, along with Myers' children Jeremiah, 11, and Shanise, five, were discovered bound and with their throats slashed in their apartment. Myers' 15-year-old son Isaiah Smith was not home at the time and was the sole survivor of the grisly attack. Details of further connections between the victims and the suspects have not been released, as the investigation remains ongoing.

Troy Police Chief James Tedesco revealed that the crime appears to have been committed on December 21, which means the victims had been dead for nearly five days before their bodies were discovered by their building's property manager. Autopsy reports are expected to clarify the exact timeline and methodology of the attacks.

Both Mann and White have entered "not guilty" pleas, with preliminary hearings set for January 4. Mann was released on parole in June after being convicted of first-degree robbery in 2014, but Chief Tedesco declined to comment on the suspects' previous charges. If convicted for the first-degree murder charges, both men could face life in prison without the possibility of parole.

As the community and families affected grieve, the Troy Police Department and district attorney continue to work diligently on the devastating case. Shakera Symes, Shanta Myers' sister, made an emotional appeal to the public for information leading to the perpetrators' arrests.
