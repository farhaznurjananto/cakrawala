The Krajina Express was an unconventional armored train utilized by the Krajina Serb army during the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War from 1991 to 1995. During this period, many armies involved in the conflict resorted to improvisation due to the breakdown of Yugoslavia in 1991, and thus both Croats and Serbs built their own armored trains. Two-wagoned and originally protected by sandbags, the Krajina Express made its debut in the Gračac and Stikada region. Its usual tactic was to appear suddenly, discharge its weapons, and then make a speedy escape. The train's crew, numbering roughly 20 people, was augmented periodically with supplies from small trucks. When the armored train was not suitable for combat operations, its crew fought in the infantry role as seen in the course of Operation Corridor. Later, the train's armor was upgraded to a 25mm thick plate, and the locomotive was outfitted with a WWII German 20mm gun, two 9K11 Malyutka missile launchers, and a Bofors 40mm gun. A Soviet-designed 76mm gun was later installed on the rear wagon, as well as two Zastava M84 machine guns and a twin 57mm multiple rocket. During the siege of Bihać, the train drew heavy fire from Bosnian forces but managed to hold its ground. However, with the deteriorating military situation in Krajina, the train was destroyed by derailing it into a ravine by its own crew during the collapse of the Republic of Krajina.
