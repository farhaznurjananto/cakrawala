Recently, a BT.com study revealed that 80% of its over 20,000 surveyed users leaned towards voting 'Leave' in the upcoming UK referendum on EU membership, scheduled for June 23rd. Alarmingly, the evidence of this study was removed from the internet. Questions of state censorship have emerged as the results could greatly impact the already struggling 'Remain' campaign.

Additionally, the study showed that the influence of Prime Minister David Cameron on the matter has actually driven many to support Brexit instead, with nearly twice as many people moving towards the 'Leave' side as a consequence of his stance. Furthermore, President Obama's intervention in support of the 'Remain' cause last month has also backfired, causing 50% more people to shift towards the 'Leave' campaign after his remarks. This data indicates that political endorsements from prominent figures may not always work as intended, and in fact, might negatively impact the very causes they champion.
