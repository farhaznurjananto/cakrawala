Food safety is a significant issue in China's food sector, which has had a string of food scandals, leading Chinese officials to conduct multiple crackdowns in the industry over many years. Recently, the Chinese government caught meat dealers passing off rat meat as mutton as part of a three-month crackdown. According to Xinhua News Agency, over 904 people were arrested, 382 meat-related offenses were discovered, and more than 20,000 tons of illegal goods seized.

The offenders used different tactics to change the product's appearance, flavor, and texture to sell it as beef or mutton. Among the practices used by the dealers, they injected water into meat, which increases the product's volume by 30%, and further diluted it with starch and chemicals such as nitrates, nitrites, or hydrogen peroxide, which can bleach the product to create meat that looks "cleaner" and fresher. 

In some cases, dealers treated fox, mink, and rat meat with chemicals to pass it off as beef and mutton. False labels were also used to misrepresent products such as wild boar as grass-fed beef. There are also reports of unsafe additives such as clenbuterol - a hazardous fat-burning drug - being used to make meat leaner and musclier.

This comes as the country's leaders aim to raise consumer spending and create greater trust in homegrown products. In the past, the food scandals have shaken confidence in domestically produced food items. Often, Chinese consumers prefer imported food. However, given the Covid-19 pandemic and trade tensions, many are starting to think twice before buying imported food. 

One incident that shook the globe was the news of horse meat found in European-sourced beef products, including IKEA meatballs in February 2013. However, such incidents are more commonplace in China, where many businesses are willing to sell fake products to make a higher profit. 

Chinese eaters have grown increasingly cautious of meat sold at low prices on the street. They are particularly concerned about cast-off mink and fox carcasses, which are selling in more significant numbers since the rise of the fur industry. People are wary of roadside vendors, where the origin and quality of meat are difficult to verify, and there are reports of recycled cooking oil and counterfeit spicy seasoning on sale as well.

The authorities are now turning their focus to the dairy and food delivery sectors in their efforts to minimize food safety challenges. Officials are checking healthcare products, dietary supplements, and expired meat products, which are still being sold on local e-commerce platforms.

The risks of food safety in China continue to alarm many people. The issue is a top priority on the government's agenda, and despite the numerous crackdowns, the problems persist. Food safety regulation may be too relaxed, while the profit margins are too high, leading to a culture of violations that must be addressed from various angles.
