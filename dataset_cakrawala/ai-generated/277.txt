The recent TIME magazine cover story about a young Afghan woman whose nose and ears have allegedly been “mutilated” by the Taliban has generated a lot of self-righteous indignation from the U.S. propaganda machine supporting the occupation of Afghanistan. In what appears to be a desperate attempt to bolster support for the American culture cleansing project in Afghanistan, TIME has published a story that lacks any specific or credible factual evidence. In fact, much of the fabricated content in the article appears to be a string of hearings and imaginings about women’s life in Afghanistan, put together by two young American journalists who probably relied on fictional accounts to write this story.

Urozgan province, where the alleged mutilation took place, is located in central Afghanistan, not Southern Afghanistan. Even if the agency of this “mutilation” were the Taliban, why would they dedicate so many precious human resources in a hostile area to the personal disenchantment of a single Taleb foot soldier with his runaway wife, Aisha? None of this makes tactical or strategic sense. TIME’s story also does not present the readers with any specific or credible factual evidence. The story sparks a lot of questions about the credibility and authenticity of the story.

The Afghan culture is complex, and it takes time and expertise to understand it fully. Many of the claims made in the TIME story are either false, exaggerated or lack evidence. Aisha’s disposition could be congenital or caused by bacterial, viral, or physical trauma such as cancer. It could be related to injuries caused by firearms or explosives – incidents that have increased steadily in Afghanistan since the expanding military interference of the United States going back to the 1980s.

The Northern Alliance warlords and their inner circles are the only Afghans that pray and beg for the American military presence in Afghanistan. And it is the Northern Alliance that opposes a political solution in Afghanistan – any such solution would remove them from power and expose and punish their criminal deeds. TIME’s reporters' informants for this story are the female dependents of this Northern Alliance criminal clique, one of whom is credited with this rabid hateful lie “I go running in the stadium where the Taliban used to play football with women’s heads.” This article has no truth value, and it appears to be propaganda aimed at using fictitious accounts about life in Afghanistan to justify the United States' continued occupation of the country.

It's crucial to fix problems at home, like racism and poverty, which can lead to inequality and war. This will make for a safer world, in which people can thrive and focus on cooperation rather than on war and occupation.
