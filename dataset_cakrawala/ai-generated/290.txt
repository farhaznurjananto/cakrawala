A team from the University of Newcastle has created a "talking kitchen" that delivers cooking instructions in French to aid language learning. The technology uses motion sensors to track the user's actions and voice commands to provide guidance in a similar format to Satnav. It was trialled first at Newcastle College and the Institut Francais, as the group investigated the software's potential for use in schools, universities and homes. The device's hope is to reverse the UK's low standing in the international league of language learning, thereby having an impact on certain industries.
 
The idea behind the talking kitchen is an innovative concept to simultaneously develop a person's French language knowledge and culinary expertise. The kitchen comes complete with a computer that enables the user to select from a range of recipes. Digital sensors built into kitchenware and equipment communicate with the device, instructing users on the right food-related actions at the right time. Cooks are also able to request the instructions or information to be revisited or translated into English, offering versatility to language instruction. 

"The primary objective is to make language learning more enjoyable, effective and educational by linking it to the development of another independent life skill," added project leader Professor Paul Seedhouse. This multi-faceted device aims to make the learning experience a more positive one by tying the academic task to an immediate and enjoyable outcome. Dubbed "The Talking Kitchen," the device comes with a price tag of £2,000 to £3,000 to install, and the group hopes to have the technology ready for commercial sale by the end of next year.
