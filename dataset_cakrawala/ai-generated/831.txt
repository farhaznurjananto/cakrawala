CTVNews.ca Personnel A letter written by an Alberta lady nearly a century ago has made its way back to its original home, providing readers with a rare peek into life in post-war Canada nearly a century ago. In 1919, Victoria Collier mailed a letter to a friend named "Miss Scholz" on stationery from the Vulcan Supply Co. in the little Alberta town of Vulcan. Around 95 years passed before the letter was suddenly rediscovered on more than half the planet. Tim Lacey, who bought the trunk in Australia a few years ago, discovered the war-era treasure that had been concealed in a traveler's trunk for over a century. The two-page letter, which was loaded with personal stories and facts of Collier's life, provided a distinct picture of life in post-World War One Canada. In it, Collier recounts daily life on Vulcan and the post-war political turmoil in the United States. The letter states, "After this war, it appears that nothing will ever be the same again; everything is upside down with strikes, and the United States is in a terrible position." "It serves them right that they are continually boasting about how they won the war, disparaging other 'Nations,' and believing they govern the world; you should be grateful they are not your neighbors." After the loss of her parents, Collier, who was born in Tasmania and attended school in England and Australia, relocated to Canada in 1908 with her husband. In addition to mentioning the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike, Collier writes about a recent royal visit by the future King of England, Edward VIII, and how she traveled to a neighbouring town to catch a sight of the Prince of Wales during his tour to Alberta that same year. "The 'Prince of Wales' visited us, and we went 95 miles to see him," she wrote. "Had a fantastic view; he is such a handsome open-faced youngster that everyone adores him." Collier also discusses the freezing conditions in Alberta and how the locals spent their time during the winter months. Collier wrote that ice sports such as 'curling,' 'hockey,' and'skating' were the order of the day. Lacey contacted the Vulcan Business Development Society in Alberta and returned the letter to Collier's family after discovering it. David Collier, Victoria's grandson, told CTV Alberta that he was stunned by the tone of the letter, which he said revealed a new side of his grandmother. "She was completely reticent, quite silent, and opinionless," he claimed. "Thank God she had these feelings and interests and someone with whom to share them." Lacey was pleased to be able to return Collier's family's letter. Janet Dirks of CTV quoted him as saying, "It's like putting a letter in a bottle and dumping it into the ocean." "I'm not religious, but I believe the letter has returned to where it should have been." The family has been provided the letter, but David has stated that it will be placed in the Vulcan museum.
