In a recent interview with Time Out New York, actor Bryan Cranston revealed everything. You might know him as Hal from Malcolm in the Middle, and his name is on our list of famous ULC ministers. He discusses his wedding ministry here: New York Times: In college, I read that you were an ordained minister. Bryan Cranston (actor): In the Church of Universal Life. Then again, who doesn't? TO: Are you sure? BC: I completed about a dozen. I did one on a plane for a couple. I did one dressed as Elvis. I once did one in a bunny suit. In 1974, the minimum wage was around $1.75. I was getting $150 per wedding, so I said, "Sure, sign me up!" TO: This sounds like a good way to make money for anyone who has been laid off. BC: There you have it! (TONY)
