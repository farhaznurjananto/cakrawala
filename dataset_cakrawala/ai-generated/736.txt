There are more alternative rock bands than ever before competing for the attention of listeners, and the competition for coverage in publications such as ours is equally intense. To stand out in this crowded arena, bands need something unique that cannot be found in their genre peers, and in our opinion, few groups do a better job of distinguishing themselves from the pack than the New Jersey seven-piece Thank You Scientist. Thank You Scientist is the first band to sign with Evil Ink Records. They have an intricate and unpredictable sound. Later this year, the label founded by Coheed And Cambria vocalist Claudio Sanchez will release the group's new album. Today, we have the privilege of premiering "Blue Automatic" from the album, and we cannot wait for you to hear it. A concise description of the material eludes us, but it resembles a combination of The Dear Hunter and the now-defunct rock band Kiss Kiss. The song is available for streaming below. When asked about the story behind the song, Thank You Scientist stated, "This is a classic TYS anthem about dealing with depression, which includes vocal injury and a near-death experience with carbon monoxide at our former rehearsal space." Thank You Scientist's forthcoming Evil Ink Records album, Stranger Heads Prevail, will be released on July 29. Pre-orders are currently available. Thank You Scientist recently released a hilarious video to promote the upcoming release of their album. Observe it now:
