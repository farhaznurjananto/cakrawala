The zombie maples attack! Last month, I went to Harvard Forest, which is 3500 acres of woods set aside for scientific research. I was there for a few days. There are a lot of short-term and long-term research projects going on in the forest. I told you a little bit about how I was able to take part in some of these studies and learn how ecologists collect and look at data. Along the way, I saw something a little strange: trees that were still alive but not growing. Those of us who aren't tree experts probably know most of what we know about tree life cycles from tree rings. In elementary school, we learned that trees make a new ring every year. When you cut down a tree, you can see a record that sometimes goes back hundreds of years. Burn marks show where there was a fire, fat rings show when resources were plentiful, and thin rings show when resources were scarce. And we know that scientists use these rings to learn about the past, to find out what was going on in local environments before people started to carefully write down this information. A tree gets a little bit bigger each time it makes a new ring. Over many years, its diameter should change. So I was surprised to see several red maple trees in Harvard Forest that hadn't grown an inch in 11 years. In 2001, scientists sized up the trees. In 2012, we went back to measure them. In that time, nothing had changed about the sizes. It turns out that I wasn't just wrong about the size. Neil Pederson is an assistant professor in the Tree Ring Laboratory at Columbia University. He has also found red maples and other trees in the Harvard Forest that are alive but not growing. They are called "zombie maples" by Pederson. He says that these trees are a good example of how different plants are, just like how different people are. Scientists have to take this into account in their work. It's also a great example of how even science that seems simple can get complicated when you look into the details. Maggie Koerth-Baker: When did you see the zombie maples for the first time? Were you looking for this, or did you just find it while doing something else? Neil Pederson: At the Eddy Flux Tower plot, I was doing research to see if we could match tree rings to the carbon flux. The Eddy Flux Tower plot is a very well-thought-out way to measure how carbon moves through a forest by taking samples from above, below, and inside the canopy. Every minute of every day, samples are taken. When I went in 2003 or 2004, it had been going on for about 11 years. They could see that the forest was always taking in carbon in the form of new growth, so they went out and measured the forest every few years to prove this. We went outside to get cores and look at the rings of the trees. I thought it would be interesting to put these tree rings in a regional context by measuring similar trees all over the Northeast. At first, I focused on red oaks because they were the biggest and most dominant trees on the plot. People think that the Eddy Flux Tower plot shows how productive an ecosystem is. Most of the time, they measure each tree. When we did our measurements, we wanted to be as efficient as possible, so we decided to see if we could get the same number by only measuring the biggest and most important trees. Maybe those are the ones that matter the most. Our tree rings didn't quite match up with the measurements from the Eddy Flux Tower. This told us that we needed to core more trees to get a good idea of how productive an ecosystem is. We went back and took the center out of the red maple. Even though they are small, these trees are the most common in the understory. We had a lot of trees and a lot of wood from these two species, so they made up a big part of the forest. And that's how I found some apple trees that were still alive but not growing. MKB: How could you tell from looking at the core samples that the trees weren't growing? When we take a core out of a tree, everyone knows that the rings tell us something about the tree's age and growth. But not every tree makes a new ring at the stem's base every year. During times of stress on the tree, some rings may be missing or may be missing in certain places. Because of this, you have to walk between the date palms. We drill holes in different trees and make sure the patterns are the same. By putting them next to each other, you can get a good idea of whether or not each ring has the right date on it. Then you keep adding trees to the comparison and build up this profile within a population and a species. I worked quickly on the first five red maples. In like a day. They don't have as clear of a ring structure as a pine or hemlock, but I thought I'd be done in four days.
