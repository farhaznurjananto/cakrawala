The sudden disappearance of the Conservative Party's manifesto from its website has raised suspicions and caused much speculation. The manifesto was replaced with an Error 404 message, indicating that the page could not be found, leaving users surprised and confused. Even though a picture of the manifesto remained on the homepage, attempts to click on the link proved futile.

Initially, it was feared that the page had been intentionally deleted by persons unknown, but it eventually reappeared on the site after around 15 minutes, without any explanation being given. The Conservative Party's press office has so far refused to comment on the incident or the reason for the sudden disappearance of the manifesto. 

The developments come just a few weeks after the Conservative Party's surprising failure to secure a majority during the recent general election. As the party tries to form a coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party to form the Government, the First Secretary of State, Damian Green, described the deal as only a “possibility”, creating further doubt and uncertainty regarding a stable Government being created in the UK.

In response to the chaos, thousands of people gathered on a "day of rage" to protest outside Downing Street, calling for Theresa May's resignation. The Queen’s Speech, which follows every general election, was scaled back for the first time in decades, with the majesty and pageantry kept to a minimum.

The current political climate is widely regarded as incredibly unstable, making many people anxious about the future of the UK. Due to the constant stream of inaccurate political news and bias surrounding traditional media sources, more people are seeking out independent news. For example, the Independent offers unbiased news and writes what they believe in, free from any influence. You can subscribe to The Independent at a low cost from just 15p a day, with added features such as exclusive events, ebooks, and a stress-free browsing experience with no ads. 

In conclusion, the disappearance of the Conservative Party's manifesto created a lot of confusion among the public and has stirred up suspicions as to what could have happened. The failure to secure a parliamentary majority in the general election has left the UK Government in a highly uncertain state, and the formation of a coalition is also causing doubt among the public. The people are calling for a stable and reliable Government, and the independent press is one source of information that people are turning to in these incredibly unstable times.
