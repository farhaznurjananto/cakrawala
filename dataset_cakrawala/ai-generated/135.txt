I found this over on tumblr, and I definitely related to it.

I was always the outcast when I was a kid. I was never one of the “popular” kids. I was always the one who was picked last for sports or any other activity. I was always the one who didn’t get invited to parties. I was always the one who was made fun of and teased.

It was always hard for me to make friends. I was always shy and withdrawn. I never knew how to act around other kids. I always felt like I was an outsider looking in.

As I got older, I began to realize that I didn’t need “friends” in the traditional sense. I had my family and they were all the friends I needed. I didn’t need to be part of the “in crowd” to be happy.

Now, as an adult, I’ve come to realize that I’m actually pretty happy with my life. I have a great family, a great job, and a great group of friends. I don’t need to be popular to be happy. I’m actually quite happy being the outcast.

I think that’s something to remember when you’re feeling down about your life. It might not be the “normal” way to live, but it’s definitely the right way for me.

This is so true, and I totally relate to it. I used to always feel like an outsider and I never felt like I fit in anywhere, but now I'm happy just the way I am. I don't need any friends that are popular or anything like that, I have my family and that's enough for me. :)

Thank you for sharing this! :)
