As the clock ticks down to the momentous legalization of recreational marijuana in California this January, a flurry of excitement is being generated within the major labor groups. United Food and Commercial Workers, United Farm Workers, and Teamsters are all chomping at the bit to unionize a staggering number of workers involved in the industry - from those who plant the seeds to those who ring up the sales.

With the Golden State's cannabis sector valued at a mind-blowing $22 billion, it's no wonder that these labor groups are eager to establish a foothold in this rapidly growing market. As they gear up for the green wave set to sweep across California, labor leaders can't help but salivate at the prospect of creating 100,000 job opportunities throughout the state.

As January 1st approaches, businesses are scrambling to secure both local permits and state licenses to secure their place in the booming marijuana market, all while keeping a watchful eye on the powerful labor groups surging ahead in establishing a strong presence in the once-taboo industry. The push for unionization signals that the cannabis market, once a hazy pipe dream, has become an incredible and thrilling economic reality.
