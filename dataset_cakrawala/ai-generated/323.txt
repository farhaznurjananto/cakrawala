Eurovision Song Contest: A Celebration of European Unity

The Eurovision Song Contest has been an annual tradition for over 60 years. This competition, which aims to showcase the unity of people and cultures in Europe, came to fruition in 1956. The founders had two main intentions for the competition. Firstly, they hoped to broadcast simultaneously live across national borders—an almost impossible feat before satellites were invented. Secondly, the founders aimed to bring different cultures together in a celebration of light entertainment.

In theory, any country can participate in the competition as long as it is within the European Broadcasting Area. Until the 1990s, the event was generally dominated by western European countries. However, the inclusion of the countries of the old Soviet Bloc in the competition has changed the look of the scoreboard dramatically, as well as the inclusion of half a dozen new countries from the former Yugoslavia.

For many countries, Eurovision presents a learning experience. They want to do well, and they may want to demonstrate that they belong with the western democracies. The competing countries tend to craft an entry that is tonally similar to those from other countries. A comparison of a Greek or Turkish Eurovision entry with a piece of domestic Greek or Turkish pop is an illuminating example of how western Europe influences pop culture worldwide.

The competition itself is often a fierce battleground, with countries vying for attention and votes. The voting reflects some level of political favor, as neighboring countries will often award each other. There is often a political subtext to the competition, with one country trying to make a statement about another. In 2017, Russia tried to send a singer who performs in a wheelchair, but who had previously broken a Ukrainian embargo on Russian artists by performing illegally in Crimea. Ukraine held its nerve and cancelled Russia's entry.

The UK has a complex relationship with Eurovision. Despite being one of the five biggest contributors to the competition’s budget, their last major victory was in 1997 with Katrina and The Waves. Every year, an embittered British commentator brings up this fact. However, the UK boasts that it has supplied the language for nearly all the entries in the competition. The dominance of English music artists and bands in European taste also adds a measure of bias to the competition.

To some countries, Eurovision is a significant opportunity to share their culture and music with Europe. Sweden's 1974 competition entry that showcased Abba is one such example. The Israeli transgender singer Dana International and the extraordinary, wonderful figure of Conchita Wurst opened a few minds when they won, in 1998 and 2014.

With each competition, ordinary people and cultures are brought closer together under the banner of music. For one night, the giants of popular culture are Azerbaijan, Serbia, and Norwegian violinists. The most fervent admirers of the competition appear to be small girls, immigrant communities, and gay men, the latter often taking it alarmingly seriously.

Eurovision has helped to bring about communication connections that national borders once made arbitrarily impossible. Whether these cultures like or understand each other beyond the event is an ongoing question. Nonetheless, the Eurovision Song Contest has demonstrated that technology and good wishes can bring disparate cultures together.
