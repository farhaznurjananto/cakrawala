The moral foundation of fair government The relationship between anarchy, freedom, and government needs to start with a moral foundation from which to draw conclusions about political and economic policy. John Locke laid the groundwork for a moral code that everyone can agree on. But Locke didn't say where this idea came from. First, I'll explain how the universal ethic comes from my 1980 book The Soul of Liberty, and then I'll use it to answer the question of how to run a country. Locke wrote in his Second Treatise (1947, p. 123), "The state of nature is governed by a law of nature that everyone must obey; and reason, which is that law, teaches all people who are willing to look at it that, since we are all equal and independent, no one should hurt another person's life, health, freedom, or possessions." This short sentence sums up the main ideas and parts of Locke's natural law, which will be the basis for the universal ethic that will be shown here. I say that "morality" is when an ethic gives moral values. This idea can be summed up as: V 7 e(A), where A is a person's action, e is an ethical principle, and V is one of the four moral values: good, bad, neutral, or undetermined. When the ethic e is applied to act A, it gives V its value. The question at hand is whether there is a universal ethic "u" that is different from cultural and personal values. This is despite the idea of subjective values, which says that all values come from individual interests and cultures. "And reason, which is that law," Locke says. The universal ethic is based on logic, and logic means that it is not made up on the spot, so it is a rational ethic. But in order to figure out such a code of ethics, we have to be able to recognize it once we know its rules. How will we know when we've created a moral code that everyone can agree on? We need some rules. In the above quote, Locke said that "reason teaches all mankind" and that all people are "equal and independent." All is the key word here. The domain of the universal ethic (the "A" in the argument) must include all people. It is universal because it applies to all people in all cultures and at all times and places. This is the first thing to look for. The universal ethic must also be "comprehensive," which means that it includes all the things that a person does. It would lose its universality if some acts were left out. So, all acts are included, which is the second criterion for the ethical domain. There are also two rules about the ethics themselves. Locke said that it is reason that teaches people what is right and wrong, so the ethic must be based on logic and the conclusion must match the premises. Reason also says that the premises themselves can't be arbitrary or based on personal or cultural values or authorities. This is the second criterion for the ethics itself. There are a total of four criteria: 1) universality in terms of people, 2) completeness in terms of acts, 3) logical consistency, and 4) non-arbitrary premises. The reason the universal ethic exists is because it is the only thing that meets all of the criteria. Accepting the criteria means that if someone can show an ethic that works for them in a unique way, then that ethic is the universal ethic. Based on these rules, the universal ethic, if it exists, must be unique. Either the premises of a second universal ethic must be different and in conflict with the first, or its rules must be compatible with the first's, so that the two can be combined into a single ethic. So, there can only be one set of moral rules that everyone must follow. What the Universal Ethic Stands On So, where will we get the premises we need for the derivation? "The state of nature has a law of nature," Locke said again. The "universal ethic" is the "law of nature." It is "the state of nature" and "the ethics of nature." What kind of thing is this? It's clear that it's not the nature of the stars or atoms that matters, but the nature of what the ethic is about: people. The nature of human beings (and whichever other species may be "persons") is such that it contains or implies an ethic. So, the premises from which the universal ethic can be drawn have to do with:
