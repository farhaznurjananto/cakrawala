Have you ever wondered what makes some people more popular than others? Researchers at Columbia University recently conducted an intriguing experiment to explore the neural basis of popularity. According to a brain-imaging study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, popular people all have one thing in common: their brains are more sensitively attuned to other people’s popularity. Here's a more extended write-up on this fascinating topic.

The experiment by Noam Zerubavel and his colleagues recruited 26 members of two student clubs. They asked each person to rate how much they liked everyone else in their club, and the researchers used these scores to rank all participants by popularity. The students then lay in brain scanners and looked at photos of the faces of their peers and an occasional “ghost face” — a morphed average of all the other faces. The students' task was to press a key as quickly as possible on each presentation to indicate whether a given face was a real person or a ghost face. However, the researchers were only interested in looking to see how their brain activity varied according to the popularity of the person they were currently looking at.

The study had two primary objectives: whether participants' brains responded differently to photos of popular individuals, and whether the brains of popular people responded differently to the exercise than those of their less popular peers. The results were fascinating.

Participants' brains did tend to show more activity in a reward- and motivation-related brain network when they looked at faces of popular peers, regardless of how much they liked that person themselves. This “valuation system" network, as the researchers call it, was excited when participants looked at faces belonging to popular peers, suggesting that we compute how well-liked someone is by others, quite separately from our judgment about whether we like them ourselves, and if we deduce that they are popular, then automatic motivational processes kick in. As a result, we might be drawn to popular individuals, even if we don't genuinely like them.

However, the sensitivity to popular faces varied from person to person. Popularity levels influenced the degree to which someone's brain tuned to the popularity of other people's faces. Less popular students showed a similar level of reward-related brain activation regardless of whose face they examined. In contrast, popular students showed a strongly graded response. The more popular the face they looked at, the more reward-related activity they showed. The researchers concluded that this was a sign of “enhanced social attunement” in popular people.

The findings also suggest that popular people enjoy affiliating with others close to the top of the social ladder (neural sensitivity to social status), providing a possible explanation of how they become popular. Researchers hypothesize that the heightened awareness of who's popular and who isn't allows popular people to better select whom to hang out with and whom to shun. However, more research is required to confirm if a person with more neural sensitivity to social status tends to get more popular over time.

Interestingly, brain responses to popular people were not dependent on personal popularity level. Instead, the more popular a face, the more neural activity participants showed in the “social cognition system” involved in understanding other people and what they think of us. Moreover, this activity and the previously described valuation system network were linked, suggesting that the more we care about a person’s popularity, the more inclined we are to try to understand what they’re thinking.

The research on popularity is in line with similar findings from animal research. For instance, macaque monkeys were willing to give up fruit juice for the chance to look at pictures of the faces of high-status peers. Another study found that teens’ gaze automatically centered on the photographs of the faces of their popular classmates over unpopular ones.

It is interesting to contrast what we’re learning about popularity with what we’re learning about loneliness. Recent studies of loneliness have shown that lonely people exhibit increased sensitivity to social threats. Therefore, it is possible that popular people's brains work in a way that reinforces their status, while the brains of lonely people are working against them, causing them to shy away from social contact that would improve their lives and make them feel better about themselves.

In summary, the study shows that popularity is a complicated issue that extends beyond personal preference. People are drawn to popular individuals even if they don't like them. It seems that popular people's brains are wired differently and work in ways that reinforce their status. Meanwhile, lonely people's brains work against them, suggesting that both popularity and loneliness are self-perpetuating.
