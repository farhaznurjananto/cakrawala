Imae: NASA The New Horizons spacecraft was launched on 19 January 2006. It reached Pluto on 14 July 2015, and is now headed towards the Kuiper Belt.

On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft made history as the first ever probe to fly-by the dwarf planet Pluto. The spacecraft made its closest approach to Pluto at 7:49 AM EDT, coming within 12,500 kilometers (about 7,800 miles) of the surface.

The New Horizons spacecraft is now headed towards the Kuiper Belt, and is expected to make a flyby of another dwarf planet, 2014 MU69, on January 1, 2019.

The New Horizons mission has returned the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons. These images have revealed a fascinating world with icy mountains, nitrogen glaciers, and a variety of other features.

The New Horizons mission has also returned data that has allowed scientists to create the first global map of Pluto. This map reveals a variety of features, including a "heart-shaped" region on the surface of Pluto.

The New Horizons spacecraft is currently traveling through the Kuiper Belt, and is expected to make a flyby of another dwarf planet, 2014 MU69, on January 1, 2019.

After the flyby of 2014 MU69, the New Horizons spacecraft will continue its journey to the outer reaches of the solar system. The spacecraft is expected to reach the Kuiper Belt settlement, Pluto-KBO, in July of 2019.

After this final mission, the New Horizons spacecraft will be placed in a hibernation mode, where it will remain until a new mission is selected.
