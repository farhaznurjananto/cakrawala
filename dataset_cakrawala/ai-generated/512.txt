On Monday, authorities in Coconut Grove successfully conducted a raid and seized approximately 100 kg of kava, a psychoactive drink with sedative properties. The raid, carried out following the execution of a search warrant at a storage facility, discovered a large illegal stash of kava.

Following the operation, three individuals – two men aged 31 and 51, and a 21-year-old woman – were apprehended and subsequently charged in connection with the discovery. The arrests mark a significant step forward in the fight against drug trade in the region.

The seized kava had an estimated street value of around $100,000, especially in remote communities where it is a popular substance. Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Malogorski revealed that the warrant was part of the ongoing investigation into kava supply in the Northern Territory; an initiative called Operation Abtei that commenced six weeks ago with the goal of curbing the illegal trade and consumption of kava.

During the search of the storage unit, law enforcement officers discovered the commercial quantity of kava further separated into several large bags, which was then divided into smaller saleable bags. This was evidence of the suspects' intent to distribute the kava. Additionally, authorities confiscated a set of digital scales and 5,000 clip seal bags, indicative of the scale of the operation.

The individuals involved in the case will be making an appearance in court. The 31-year-old male is scheduled to appear before the Darwin Magistrates Court on July 27, while the 21-year-old woman and the 51-year-old man will have their hearings on August 4. The legal consequences they face could serve as a deterrent for others who may consider engaging in the kava trade.

Since its inception, Operation Abtei has been remarkably successful. In just six weeks, the police have managed to seize 510 kg of kava, which is worth an estimated $510,000. As the operation continues, it is expected that more arrests and seizures will be made in the Northern Territory.

Law enforcement agencies are actively encouraging the public to come forward with any information they may have on the transportation and sale of drugs, particularly kava, within the Northern Territory. Those with knowledge or information are urged to contact the police on 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Reporting illegal activities and cooperating with the authorities will be crucial in ending the illegal drug trade in the region.
