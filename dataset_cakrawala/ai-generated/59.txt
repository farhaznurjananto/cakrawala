Cambridge, Guelph and now Waterloo will be the only Canadian universities to offer a comprehensive degree in actuarial science.

"This is an exciting and cutting-edge program which will give students the skills they need to enter an exciting and well-paid profession," said Waterloo President Feridun Hamdullahpur.

"Our actuarial science program has a reputation for excellence and we're proud to be a leader in this area in Canada."

The new program offers a co-operative education option.

Actuarial science uses mathematics, statistics and financial theory to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries.

Students in the program will take courses in mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics and finance. They'll also take specialized actuarial science courses.

During their fourth year, students will be able to choose one of five areas of concentration: general insurance, life insurance, investments and financial services, pensions, enterprise risk management and health insurance.

The university's actuarial science program was established in 1981 and is recognized by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. The new program will be offered in the Faculty of Science.

Waterloo is one of Canada's leading universities with more than 41,000 students. It has a reputation for excellence in research, teaching and innovation. The university is dedicated to helping students reach their full potential and transforming the way they learn. In recent years, Waterloo has won numerous awards, including the 2015 Research Excellence Award from the Canadian Association of University Teachers and the 2016 Canadian Institutes of Health Research Top 100 Award for Research Excellence.
