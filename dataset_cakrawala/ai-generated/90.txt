A 55-year-old former banker has undergone a sex change operation to become a woman - and plans to marry her best friend. 
Kamaljit Sandhu, who was born male, has had hormone treatment, laser hair removal and surgery to create breasts. 
She has changed her name from Kami to Kam, and wants to be known as a woman. 
But her best friend of 15 years, Melanie Coleman, 38, who she plans to marry, is still unsure about her feelings. 
Miss Coleman, who lives with Miss Sandhu in the village of Kineton, near Stratford-Upon-Avon, said: 'I've known Kam for 15 years, and I have never once thought of her as anything but a man. 
'The sex change hasn't made any difference to me. You would never look at her and think she was anything but a woman.'  But she added: 'I'm still not sure what to call her. I call her "him" at the moment, but I'm sure I can get used to it.' 
Miss Sandhu, who is unemployed and has been on the dole most of her life, said: 'I always felt like I was in the wrong body. I never felt comfortable in my skin. 
'I've been looking for a way to change my life for a long time, and the sex change was the final step. I'm excited about the prospect of being able to marry my best friend.' 
Miss Coleman said she is still trying to come to terms with the fact that her friend has undergone a sex change, but she is supportive. 
She said: 'I'm not sure what to call her yet, but I'm glad she's happy. I just hope she can find a job and get her life sorted out.' 
Miss Sandhu said she is not worried about how her friends will react when they find out she is transgender. 
She said: 'I'm confident that they will accept me for who I am. I'm just glad they're still my friends.'
