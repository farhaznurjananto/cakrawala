POLICE have charged Ella Tromp with car theft, the latest twist in the family saga that has engulfed Australia. Following inquiries from news.com.au, Victoria police confirmed the filing of two charges. According to a spokeswoman, on August 30 in Victoria, a 22-year-old Silvan woman was charged with theft of a motor vehicle and possession of the proceeds of a crime [the car]. She was released on bail and ordered to appear in Ringwood Magistrates Court on April 19, 2017. Her sister Riana was also charged with theft of a motor vehicle, but the charge was dropped under section 33 of the NSW Mental Health Act. Despite spending time and resources in two states looking for the family, police said no other charges were expected against any other family member. Since it was revealed that the Tromp sisters had allegedly taken the car after fleeing their parents at the Jenolan Caves, authorities have been increasingly concerned about their erratic behavior. When asked how Ella and Riana left Jenolan Caves, police stated that they did so in a car that they did not rent or own. Riana had been separated from her sister and was discovered in a catatonic state in the back of a local man's ute in Goulburn. THE UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS Mark Tromp, who went missing with his wife Jacoba and children Mitchell, Ella, and Riana, was the last member of the family to be found on Saturday, after his wife was discovered in Yass on Thursday. He is alive and well, at least physically, but the mystery is far from over. We have almost as many questions as answers. Where was Mark for the five days he was missing, when the entire country seemed to be looking for him? Jacoba arrived at the hospital on Thursday, dazed and agitated. She was then transferred to a mental health facility in Goulburn. But where had she been between the time she left her husband on Tuesday and the time she arrived in Yass two days later? And how did she get to Yass? The family's mental health problems have also been a source of consternation. How could multiple members of the same family have such serious delusions at the same time? Why were they all so convinced that someone was after them? What caused the family's breakdown? According to police, they had no debts and no one was pursuing them. Mitchell and Ella, the couple's children, told reporters yesterday that they couldn't explain what happened. But have they revealed everything? Perhaps most bizarre is the fact that the Tromps' children, Mitchell and Ella, appear to be as perplexed as the rest of Australia about what went wrong. Speaking to the media yesterday, they shared few clues about the ordeal even though they were there for part of it and admitted the whole five-day mystery was "hard to explain". They were both "still confused" about the trip. "I had to accompany the family because I was curious about where they were going," Mitchell explained. "I couldn't abandon them. But, yes, it was difficult to see your family in that state, and I've never seen anything like it." When asked what prompted the trip, Ella stated: "It's very confusing, and I'm still confused. I believe our mental states weren't in the best shape, and there's no single reason for it. It's strange." "Police are still investigating," the siblings said when asked for more information. The kids expressed their love for their missing father in an earlier public appeal for help when Mark was still missing. "He's not a threat; he's my friend and father. I adore him "Mitchell stated to reporters. Pressure had apparently been building on the usually happy family in the days before they fled their Silvan home a lush and sprawling berry farm where visitors are welcomed to pick redcurrant berries and explore the idyllic livestock-studded surrounds. Mitch stated that his father had become "paranoid" as a result of a "series of different, normal everyday events," which caused him and Jacoba to unravel and take the rest of the family with them. "I've never seen anything like it before," Mitch remarked. "It's really hard to explain or put a word on it but they were just fearing for their lives and then they decided to flee". Mitch said the "pressure", as he described it, "slowly got worse as the days went by". He has attempted to explain his father's disappearance by claiming that he "believes that people are looking for him. He is not in a good mental state ".
