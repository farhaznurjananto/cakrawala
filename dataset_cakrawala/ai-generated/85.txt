Real-time strategy games are, in a way, the perfect genre for mobile devices. They tend to be relatively quick to get into, and can be played for just a few minutes at a time. But it’s a tough genre to get right, and it’s even tougher to make a game that’s fun and challenging without being overwhelming.

That’s where Iron Marines comes in. It’s a new RTS from the makers of the excellent Kingdom Rush series, and it’s one of the best mobile strategy games I’ve played in a long time.

Iron Marines is a bit of a departure for Kingdom Rush developer Ironhide Game Studio. Instead of the fantasy setting of the Kingdom Rush games, Iron Marines is set in a sci-fi universe. You play as a commander of a team of marines, and your job is to protect the galaxy from an evil alien race known as the Hive.

The game is split into a series of missions, each of which has you defending a different planet from the Hive. Each mission has its own unique challenges, and you’ll need to use a different mix of units to succeed.

There are three different types of units in Iron Marines: marines, support units, and artillery. Marines are the basic unit, and are the only unit that can attack. Support units are like tanks, and can attack both ground and air units. Artillery is a special type of unit that can attack only ground units.

Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it’s important to use the right unit for the right job. You don’t want to send your marines into an enemy artillery unit, for example, because they’ll be slaughtered.

One of the things I love about Iron Marines is how well it balances the strategy and the action. Each battle is tense, and it’s hard to know exactly what will happen next. But at the same time, the game is easy to pick up and play.

There are plenty of different ways to win a battle in Iron Marines, and it’s up to you to find the best way to do it. You can use brute force, and try to take out the enemy units one by one. Or you can use your support units to protect your marines, and use your artillery to take out the enemy units from a distance.
