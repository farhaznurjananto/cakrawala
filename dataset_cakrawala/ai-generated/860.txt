10 Ways to Meet New People These ten ways to make friends work even if you don't have access to the Internet. Making friends as an adult on your own can be a daunting task; for a while, it may feel like you're dating for friends or interviewing people for a job. It's okay to feel that way; it's also a good idea to be picky about who you allow to have that "friend" status in your life. Try the following suggestions to make new friends quickly. 1.Take a Course Taking a class where there will be plenty of interaction with other people doing something that interests you is one of the simplest ways to make new friends. Look in your local newspaper or on the Internet for classes on everything from model airplane construction to acrylic painting. The other students in the class are most likely there to make friends as well, so you'll be in good company. 2.Join a Group A sports team, like a class, is another way to meet new people while also taking care of your body. Sports teams of various levels are available for almost any sport you might be interested in. After practice, suggest that the group go out for a smoothie or a beer to get to know each other better. 3.Volunteer If you are passionate about a cause, you may want to meet people through volunteer opportunities. Consider volunteering at your local zoo or humane society, a food shelf, a homeless shelter, hospice, or your child's school. While volunteering, you will meet other people who share your interests. 4.Go to a Religious Service Churches and synagogues typically have social groups set up to assist their members in developing friendships. Check with your faith's local religious organization to see what social activities are available. 5.Meet the Parents of Your Children You have an instant connection with other parents if you have children. Start a conversation with other moms and dads and invite them in for a cup of coffee during your child's play date. Because you both have children, you'll have plenty to talk about. 6.Be Approachable This may seem obvious, but you'd be surprised at how few people truly understand what it means to be friendly. You want to come across as friendly, approachable, and compassionate. This means you may need to smile more than you are used to, as well as be affirmative in your speech and body language. If people aren't responding positively to you, check yourself in the mirror to make sure you're coming across as warm and friendly rather than cool and aloof. 7.Look After Your Appearance People notice your appearance first, so make sure you are appropriately dressed, clean, and stand up straight. Wear your favorite outfit when going out to meet new people; it will boost your confidence. 8.Be the First to Act It would be nice if being friendly was enough, but it isn't always the case. You must strike up a conversation or crack a joke, openly share information about yourself, and offer to exchange contact information. While this may seem intimidating at first, it will become easier with practice. 9.Show Interest in Others One of the biggest turn-offs is someone who only talks about himself or herself. Inquire about the other person, then relate what he or she says to events in your own life. Make a connection between the two of you. 10.Set Negativity Aside No one wants to be friends with a complainer or a backstabber, so put your negative thoughts aside and show your bright side. Once you're truly friends, you'll have time for therapeutic discussions about bad drivers or politics. For the time being, concentrate on the positive and getting to know your new friend.
