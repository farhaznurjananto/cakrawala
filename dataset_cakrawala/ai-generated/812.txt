Description BUSTER BASH is the official mobile game of Buster Posey, an All-Star catcher. Follow in Buster's footsteps by beginning in the backyard of Leesburg, Georgia and eventually reaching the Big Leagues' elite ranks. Per round, you are given ten baseballs to hit as many home runs as possible. By knocking sunflower seeds out of the sky or through in-app purchases, players can acquire equipment and power-ups to improve their hitting. Swipe the screen to send pitches over the outfield or barn fence. As a child, you'll hit tennis balls and wiffle balls, but as you advance, it's all hardballs and the pitchers become more formidable! Features include: + original music from Battery Amp + equipment upgrades through the UNDER ARMOUR store + five levels: Backyard in Leesburg, the TOYOTA Youth Championship, the UNDER ARMOUR All-American Game, College Playoffs, and the Big Leagues Follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook to be eligible for official Buster Bash prizes.
