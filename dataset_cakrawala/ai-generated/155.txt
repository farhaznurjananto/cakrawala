We are excited to announce the return of our novella program!

Tor.com is looking for submissions of original science fiction, fantasy, and horror stories of up to 12,000 words in length. We are especially interested in stories that push boundaries, experiment with form, and explore new ways of telling stories. We want to hear from authors who are daring and experimental, and who have a passion for writing.

The novella program is open to new and unpublished authors. You don’t need to have a novel or story ready to go; all you need is a great idea and the willingness to write. We are also excited to announce that Tor.com will be paying $5,000 and publication on the story’s first edition.

For more information, please see the official Tor.com submission guidelines.

Good luck!

Sincerely,
