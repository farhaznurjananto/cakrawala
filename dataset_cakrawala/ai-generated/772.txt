The  conundrum faced by the Denver Nuggets  has become a healthy topic of discussion over the past year. 
  The debate,  centered on whether  Nikola Jokic and Jusuf Nurkic could play together in Denver's front yard, took a different turn when the Nuggets fought their way to the Spurs in  early April as the Jokic duo and Nurkic  dominated an exhausted Spurs. First line. 
 The duo reappeared two nights later against the Jazz, except this time Utah's smaller frontline with Trey Lyles in 4th, exploited the Nuggets' Twin Towers look. 
 At the end of last season, we only had  92 minutes in the Jokic vs Nurkic game to think. The combination produces 96.2 OffRtg, 103.4 DefRtg, bounces the ball at  a league average  of 49.4% and plays at a slow, 96.45 possession per 48 minutes, per NBA .com 
 
 Last season was a small example of what Jokic and Nurkic can do together on the pitch, but  to play any minute in attack in the future, Jokic needs to improve his defence. He needs to be able to close in and stay with strong outfield-oriented forwards who thrive in today's NBA speed and space. 
 This is exactly what Jokic intends to improve  this summer.  
 "I want to do everything," Jokic told CBS 4 of what he's been doing this season. "Shooting, especially my defense. I want to play four-man next season, so I want four-man defense."
