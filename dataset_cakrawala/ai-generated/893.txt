Gina McCarthy, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, testifies on Capitol Hill in September 2013 before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power. The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants on Friday. The long-awaited announcement brings the agency one step closer to meeting a key pillar of President Obama's ambitious climate plan, which calls for cutting carbon pollution from both new and existing power plants. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy touted the agency's plan to reporters at the National Press Club as "one of the most significant actions we can take" to protect public health and the environment from the dangers of climate change. "By taking commonsense steps to limit carbon pollution from new power plants, we can mitigate the effects of climate change while also fulfilling our obligation to provide a safe and healthy environment for our children," McCarthy said. Noting that power plants have "really long lifetimes," McCarthy explained that "people are making decisions about these plants today, and that is why we need to act today." The standards, according to the administrator, will "ensure a clear path forward for a full energy mix." According to the proposal, the EPA would require a single standard for large natural gas plants, allowing for emissions of 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour of power generated. Another, slightly less stringent standard would apply to coal-fired facilities, allowing for 1,100 lbs. of CO2 emissions per megawatt hour. According to EPA air officials, a modern gas plant could meet the standard but not a coal plant. The plan calls for future coal plants to install equipment for capturing and storing carbon pollution on a limited scale, which officials describe as "a simpler, less expensive way to reduce carbon emissions." Officials from the agency describe their proposal as "both flexible and achievable." They point to the construction of four coal plants that will use carbon capture and storage technology as evidence that this technology is available and ready to use. They believe that, as with most technologies, the price will fall over time. The proposed rule essentially mirrors emissions standards that the EPA put forth in March 2012, setting off a fierce lobbying frenzy among coal companies and coal-burning utilities opposed to what they consider to be an effective ban on coal plants. Opponents claim that the latest proposal would have the same effect. "We don't believe any new coal plants will be built as a result of this rule," Paul Bailey of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the coal industry's most vocal advocate, said on Friday. "We believe that this rule is extremely harmful to coal plants, as well as to carbon capture and storage." ————————————- Don't miss a single investigation on the environment conducted by the Center for Public Integrity.

They point out that none of the four coal plants mentioned by EPA officials are currently operational; two are under construction, and two are in the planning stages. They contend that, for the most part, these are government-funded demonstration projects with conditions that cannot be replicated at coal plants across the country. "Until a few months ago, no one would have believed that the EPA would claim that carbon capture was demonstrated technology," said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lobbyist at Bracewell & Guiliani who represents coal and utility companies. He described the new EPA plan as "surprisingly aggressive," noting that the agency's 2012 proposal did not make such a claim. He predicted that the coal and utility industries would oppose the agency's reliance on emerging technology as the foundation for an emissions standard. "There will undoubtedly be a lot of discussion about this," said Holmstead, who led the EPA's air office under President George W. Bush. "There will be litigation if the EPA says, 'This is the standard.'" Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, criticized the EPA proposal in a statement "This is wonderful news. Combating carbon pollution from power plants is critical to addressing the current climate crisis." The EPA proposal must go through a 60-day public comment period, and the agency plans to hold a public hearing.
