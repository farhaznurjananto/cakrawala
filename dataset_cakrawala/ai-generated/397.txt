Preparations for a direct military assault on Syria are being made by Turkey alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to reports. Some reports have suggested that the military offensive could take place in the coming days, whilst others have forecasted a possible attack sometime towards the end of June.

At present, Turkish forces are reportedly gathering along both the southern border of their nation and Syria's northern border, activities which could imply little except the presence of military action. However, for some time, the stage appears to have been set for an attack.

In the past few weeks, geopolitical alliances and talks have combined to indicate that such action is highly likely in the near future. The US and NATO have been working to gain support for a direct assault on Syria since the crisis began, as it became apparent that the use of proxy armies of terrorists alone would not achieve regime change.

Turkey has been a key player, with plans for the operation reportedly twofold. Firstly, the plan should be viewed as part of NATO's agenda since the moment rebels were driven back by Assad's forces, and Turkey has always played a significant role in this regard. Secondly, Prime Minister Recep Erdoğan’s own party has been hit hard by several scandals, criticisms, and failures over the past few months, and foreign conflict could be of assistance in diverting attention away from internal issues.

The Saudis have recently shown their willingness to intervene militarily in the region by leading a coalition of Arab nations in launching airstrikes against the Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen. Criticised for their actions, it is thought that they may be gearing up to act in coalition against Syria now. According to sources cited by the Huffington Post, the Turks and the Saudis are currently in "high level talks" concerning an agreement to form a military alliance to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power in Syria.

Turkey and Saudi Arabia have traditionally been at odds, despite both being NATO and US allies. However, at present, they are showing greater willingness to work together. Andrew Korybko highlights: "This deadly collaboration proves that the two have temporarily put aside their ideological differences and agreed to sort it out in the aftermath of their unified regime change operation."

One key issue behind the planned invasion is the Iran gas line that is intended to have a route through Syria. Reportedly, the plan was drawn up in Ankara, Turkey in collusion with the Qataris, who have vested interests in the region due to this pipeline. The plan appears to involve gaining a foothold in the north of Syria, with an attack on Damascus to then follow from the Qalamoon, Qunaytra, and possibly from Der'ah in the south.

At this point, the Turkish Army is reportedly already gathering at the southern border of the country prepared to invade while providing military support to ISIS. It is expected that the Turks will use their American-manufactured bombers to assist in attacks, while Saudi Arabia has pledged air support of its own. Meanwhile, official statements from Qatar mention that they will provide ground troops in order to invade Syria.

In conclusion, the situation in Syria appears to be rapidly deteriorating as foreign nations prepare to invade. The exact timeline of this event may not yet be evident, but it appears that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar plan to act together, with US backing, in order to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power in Syria.
