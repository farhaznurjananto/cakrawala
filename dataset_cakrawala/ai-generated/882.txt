Director Baz Luhrmann's $125 million adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has had people talking for two years now. On May 10, audiences worldwide will finally be able to see this highly anticipated film, in either 2D or 3D. The twentieth century saw three onscreen versions of Fitzgerald's classic American novel, most notably Jack Clayton's 1974 film featuring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. It wasn't a bust at the box office, but viewers are expecting much more zing from the 2013 rendition. Here's why: 1. Music Luhrmann's vision was to reproduce the excitement of 1920s jazz by integrating contemporary music for a modern audience. "We our audience are living in the 'hip-hop age' and want our viewers to feel the impact of modern-day music the way Fitzgerald did for the readers of his novel at the time of its publication," Luhrmann said. Who better to co-produce the film's soundtrack than hip-hop king, Jay-Z? Singles from the soundtrack have been rolling out over the last few months. The music represents a blending of styles electronic, hip-hop, rap, jazz and classical by a variety of renowned artists. Lana Del Rey's "Young & Beautiful," The xx's "Together," and Nero's "Into the Past" are standout tracks. The full soundtrack, which includes songs by the likes of Jay-Z, Beyonc, Sia, Gotye, Andr 3000 and Florence + the Machine, comes out on May 7. 2. Fashion Catherine Martin, Luhrmann's wife, has 20 years of experience designing sets and costumes under her belt. Martin proved her forte for recreating early 20th century aesthetics in Moulin Rogue, so all eyes are on her work for The Great Gatsby. For the actors' wardrobes, she collaborated with acclaimed designers to give the 1920s vintage look a high-fashion twist.
