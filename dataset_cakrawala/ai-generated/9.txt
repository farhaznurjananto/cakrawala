This is a very informative article. I would like to know if you have any suggestions on how to get my dog to stop jumping on people.

There are a few things you can do to try and get your dog to stop jumping on people. First, try to train them using positive reinforcement. This means providing them with treats or petting when they are behaving in a way you want them to. Another thing you can do is try to create a barrier between your dog and people. This could be by installing a fence or by placing furniture between your dog and people. Finally, make sure you keep your dog supervised when they are around people. This way, if they do start to jump on people, you can quickly stop the behavior. Good luck!
