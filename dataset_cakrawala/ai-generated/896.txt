Data reveal that while police departments are concentrating more on so-called "hate crime" and "malicious communications," the number of arrests made by British police has decreased. According to recent Home Office data, arrests have decreased by a startling 48% over the past nine years and by a whopping 11% over the past year, according to MailOnline. Despite sharp rises in reported crime, police only made 779,660 arrests in the year ending March 2017 compared to almost 1.5 million in the year ending March 2008. In the year leading up to June 2017, overall crime increased by 19%, with violent crime increasing by 19%, rape increasing by 22%, knife crime increasing by 26%, and gun crime increasing by an astounding 27% despite strict regulations on legal gun ownership. Shoplifting, burglaries, robberies, and other acquisitive crimes are all on the rise, and just one out of every ten burglaries have a suspect in custody. Police in England are having a crisis with crime up 13%, rape up 22%, and only one in nine burglaries being solved. Breitbart London, October 19, 2017, via Twitter Authorities attribute the dramatic decline in arrests to sweeping budget cuts that have driven down the number of police officers by 20,000, to the lowest level since 1985. Veteran officers claim that these budget cuts have rendered forces blind in areas where radical Islam is thriving and have decreased the flow of local intelligence to the security services, providing strong anecdotal evidence that these cuts have indeed hollowed out community policing to some extent. The Tories argue that the cuts they have been making are necessary to reduce the deficit left to them by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, but they have been implemented at a time when both the foreign aid budget and financial contributions to the European Union have been rising year over year. The cuts were first made in conjunction with the Liberal Democrats and then on their own after the 2010â€“15 coalition came to an end. Free speech? At Least 3,395 Individuals Are Arrested by British Police for "Offensive" Internet Remarks in a Single Year On October 14, 2017, Jack Montgomery (@JackBMontgomery) Nonetheless, there are allegations that British police units are not making the best use of their limited resources. For instance, hundreds of people were detained in 2016 for allegedly insulting online remarks; this number increased by 53% in London, making it now more dangerous than New York City, where police numbers are generally equivalent to London, and by an astounding 877% in the West Midlands. While boasting of having more than 900 specialized officers dedicated to "hate crime" investigations, the Metropolitan Police has even suggested that they will not even bother investigating many so-called "low-level" crimes like shoplifting and vandalism anymore because it is "not practical" in a time of cutbacks.

Many people have added to the unfavorable exposure these events have received by becoming incensed at the criticism they have received online and threatening to find the people who posted the criticism.
