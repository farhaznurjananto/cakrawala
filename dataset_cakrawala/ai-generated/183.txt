Asylum seeker policy has long been a flashpoint in Australian politics, but with the most recent policy, the Nauru Solution, even more explosive.

In 2015, a leaked report into the Nauru detention centre was published by The Guardian, revealing horrific details of sexual abuse, self-harm and mental illness among detainees.

The report led to a Royal Commission being established to investigate the allegations. The Commission's report is due to be released on Wednesday.

The Nauru Solution is a policy that was announced by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in September 2017.

Under the policy, all asylum seekers who arrive by boat will be transferred to offshore detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

The policy has been heavily criticised by human rights groups and has been branded as inhumane.

In a speech made in July, Turnbull said that the Nauru Solution was "the best and final solution" for the asylum seeker problem.

In a recent poll, 72 per cent of Australians said that they support the Nauru Solution.

The poll was conducted by the Australian National University and is due to be released on Wednesday.

The poll has been criticised by human rights groups.

"This poll is a disgrace," said refugee advocate and campaign co-ordinator for the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser.

"It's a disgrace that Australians are being asked to support a policy that will result in more people dying in detention, more children being separated from their families, and more people being subjected to the cruelty and abuse of offshore detention."

The poll was conducted between July 11 and 17 and surveyed 1,849 Australians.
