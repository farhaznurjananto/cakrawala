“All I really need is love, but a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt!” - Charles M. Schulz

This sage advice from Charles Schulz perfectly captures the spirit behind the ultimate vegan Valentine's treat: delectable Chocolate Raspberry Brownie Bars. To make these even more appealing, they are also gluten-free.

Chocolate has long been known as the ultimate aphrodisiac and the ultimate food. The best part? It's not just delicious – it's beneficial for you as well. Pure dark chocolate, the kind that can be enjoyed slowly over hours, is enriched with antioxidants that support your health and heart. However, this doesn't mean you should indulge in countless candy bars; moderation is key.

To create a healthier and guilt-free brownie bar, these delicious treats were made without added fats and were made gluten-free. Most of the recipes posted at Holy Cow! are incidentally gluten-free. When baking, however, wheat is often utilized, even though it's not necessarily bad for you. Nonetheless, gluten, a protein in wheat that serves as a building block in baked goods, is not suitable for those suffering from celiac disease – a disorder that affects about 1 percent of the U.S. population. For everyone else, wheat can be consumed safely without causing illness, although whole wheat is always a healthier choice than refined wheat.

The debate over choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, regardless of medical necessity, continues to gain momentum. Proponents of a gluten-free diet argue that humans do not fully digest wheat, it is a major allergen, and potentially a significantly larger number of people are affected by celiac disease than current diagnoses suggest. Conversely, skeptics maintain that the trend is primarily just a fad and uphold the long-standing belief in the nutritional benefits of wheat, a staple food for various cultures across centuries.

In response to this ongoing discussion, the New York Times’ Well blog published an article that explored the gluten-free trend, prompting many to evaluate their dietary preferences, experiment with gluten-free products, and explore gluten-free baking. Gluten-free baked goods have a distinct taste and texture compared to their wheat-based counterparts, primarily due to the use of different whole-grain and starch-based flours, such as sorghum, brown rice, arrowroot, and tapioca.

These Chocolate Raspberry Brownie Bars, with their harmonious blend of raspberry and walnut flavors, are dense, chewy, slightly gooey, and simply delightful. While not every baking endeavor may be exclusively gluten-free in the future, the outcome of these tasty bars promises many more delicious experiments.

We hope you have enjoyed this Valentine's Day series showcasing heart-healthy and aphrodisiac foods. A special thanks to Samantha and Kristen for inspiring these mouth-watering recipes, and we wish you all a very happy Valentine's Day – full of love and a bit of chocolate.
