Taiwan has arrested an alleged Chinese spy, marking the first apprehension of its kind in decades, according to Taiwan's National Security Bureau. This major arrest has raised several questions among the residents of Taipei, such as whether China will attempt to make a swap deal in order to get the alleged spy back.

The alleged spy, Zhen Ziaojiang, a mainlander, reportedly led a spy ring that included five Taiwanese citizens. These individuals have also been charged with spying for China. The indictment has identified them as former Army Major General Hsu Nai-chuan, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Chou Chih-li, Air Force pilot Sung Chia-lu, Air Force official Yang Jung-hua, and karaoke club owner Lee Huan-yu.

According to various media reports, Zhen was a captain and an intelligence officer in the People's Liberation Army. This association has given rise to the assumption that the Army's Second Department of the General Staff Department was responsible for overseeing the operation. 

In 2005, Zhen managed to obtain residency in Hong Kong and began visiting Taiwan frequently on what were assumed to be business and tourist trips. However, it is now alleged that these trips served as a cover for secret missions to recruit Taiwanese military officers to an intelligence network that harvested crucial data. Among the information obtained by the network were details related to the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter, early warning radar systems built by Raytheon on Leshan Mountain in Hsinchu County, and confidential procurement plans. 

The payments received by the network's agents are believed to have totaled around $9,400, along with additional perks such as complimentary trips to popular Southeast Asian tourist destinations. 

More than 90% of the 15 cases of Chinese espionage uncovered since 2014 have involved either active or retired military personnel, according to a report presented to the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee by the National Security Bureau. 

Since the beginning of 2014, China and Taiwan have established bilateral economic and travel agreements with the election of Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008. Interestingly, military morale has declined as a result, with fewer Taiwanese military officers seeing a viable career in the military. Consequently, this has raised concerns about possible further recruitment and targeting of disgruntled officers for espionage.

In light of the 2009 Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, cross-strait ties have flourished significantly. From having no commercial flights a week in 2008, there are now 700 cross-strait commercial flights a week, with around 3 million Chinese visitors to the island annually. The joke among several government officials in Beijing is that it will be easier to buy Taiwan than invade it, as reported by various media outlets.

However, the implications of this espionage case have been severe. In recent years, Taiwanese military officers have sold crucial information to China regarding the E-2K Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 and PAC-2 anti-ballistic missile systems, and Hawk air defense missile system. Taiwan's defense sources indicate that China has collected enough information to compromise numerous crucial defense systems and programs.
