Minnesota Target store employees are on the brink of a strike, having issued an ultimatum to their employers demanding discussions of grievances and issues relating to terms and conditions of employment. If their employers have not held talks about their conditions by noon on Sunday, the employees, who are contracted to three companies, namely Carlson Building, Diversified Maintenance Systems and Prestige Maintenance, will commence their strike, which will further disrupt Target after prolonged economic challenges for the business. The employees, who work in the service sector, are demanding proper safety training, along with complaints about retaliation and other illegal issues which they feel have been ignored by management, according to the Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha (CTUL), the union that represents employees at the site. The group emerged in the Twin Cities to protect and champion employees' rights to work in a safe and supportive environment, and it recently orchestrated strikes in Walmart and the fast-food sector. CTUL is working with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to bid for formal recognition and group bargaining rights for its members, who could join the SEIU, although it would remain their main representative.
