MYEFO expected to reveal $120 billion projected deficit

The Morrison government is expected to reveal a $120 billion budget deficit when it hands down its economic update on Thursday.

The MYEFO, which is the government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, is expected to outline a further deterioration in the nation's finances.

The government had already forecast a $85 billion deficit for the 2020-21 financial year, but that is expected to blow out to more than $100 billion when the MYEFO is released.

The budget is expected to show that the government's tax receipts have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with a $60 billion drop in company tax revenue and a $30 billion fall in personal income tax receipts.

The government is also expected to unveil a new $15 billion stimulus package to boost the economy.

The package is expected to include measures to support businesses and jobs, as well as measures to help Australians with the cost of living.

The MYEFO is also expected to reveal that the government's debt levels are expected to blow out to $1.1 trillion by 2023-24.

The government is also expected to announce that it is slashing the budget by $30 billion over the next four years.

The MYEFO is due to be released on Thursday at 3pm AEST.
