Images by Andrew Burr Breaking News: The U.S. Forest Service has banned sport climbing on public lands until the use of equipment that complies with UIAA standards is implemented. Well, you lied; it still hasn't taken place. The second Future of Fixed Anchors Conference was co-hosted by the Access Fund (AF) and Petzl in April 2016. In Las Vegas, around 60 policy wonks, bolting geeks, and climbing organization representatives from across the country discussed bolting, hardware, removal techniques, funding, liability insurance for hardware-replacement organizations, best practices, worst practices, and bolting as a public service. The next proposals for UIAA materials were also discussed. ADVERTISEMENT Please enjoy the rest of the show. Go to the URL When sport climbing first took off in the 1990s, thousands upon thousands of bolts were placed at crags around the United States. After more than two decades, this equipment is finally dying. It's possible that many of these rusty nuts and bolts still work. But, there are plenty of people who aren't. If even one bolt on a sport climb fails, it can have disastrous results. Also, many of us break safety regulations. How often do you bail on a route after one bad bolt? How about a victory whip? Or you get a direct clip while your partner abseils you down to save her dog from a scrap. ADVERTISEMENT Please enjoy the rest of the show. PROMOTION: Go to This Site Please enjoy the rest of the show. Go to the URL Modern climbing bolts are sturdy and reliable enough that accidents are uncommon when used properly. When bolts age, they become problematic. Also, bolts are getting old all over the United States. The majority of fasteners installed in the 1990s and earlier were made of zinc-plated steel. Iron rusts when exposed to oxygen, but chain-link fences are protected from this by zinc coatings. Since zinc has such a powerful reaction with oxygen, zinc-plated steel will not rust if kept exposed to the air. Zinc coating on bolts is thin and electroplated (so that the tiny threads still function). Zinc quickly deteriorates into zinc oxide, which may be scraped away, or zinc chloride, which can be washed away, both of which remove the protective layer and expose the underlying steel. Similar to removing the shell from an egg. When the edible iron inside the bolt's shell has been removed. Depending on the environment, rust can destroy a bolt in a few years or a few decades. Even worse, the corrosion is concealed within the crater and is therefore impossible to detect. The inside of bolt holes create shaded, frequently moist micro-environments that contain water, only to dry and concentrate the minerals that hasten corrosion, even in dry climbing locations. The hanger and bolt itself may look fine, but the inside pieces, such as the tiny clips and wedges that grasp the rock and hold falling, may be damaged. One ancient bolt on some 20-year-old sport routes that Kenny Parker, the principal re-equipper for New River Alliance of Climbers (NRAC) in West Virginia's New River Gorge, has replaced may be quite powerful and require hard crowbarring to move. A further bolt, only a few feet away, also pulls or snaps off without any difficulty. It's impossible to say. Anybody up for a triumphant whipping? Even though bolts are getting old, most major climbing places have local communities working to replace them with stainless steel hardware. The "stainless" procedure, in contrast to zinc plating, incorporates the oxygen-attracting metals into the steel itself; thus, the corrosion-resistant shell of the bolt is constantly renewed. Yet, removing and replacing bolts, or even just re-drilling old holes or creating new ones, may be a costly and time-consuming endeavor. It can take a trained worker all day, often longer, to re-equip a single sport route in places like Boulder and Yosemite where there is a strong commitment to reusing original bolt holes. More time is needed if the rock is steep, glue-ins are used, access is limited, or the anchors can't be relied upon to make re-equipping easier. It could take a skilled individual two to three weeks of full-time work to re-equip a small sport climbing sector like the Arsenal at Rifle Mountain Park, Colorado. The Arsenal is just one of thirty areas in the relatively compact climbing destination known as Rifle. If you consider the hundreds of climbing areas across the country, that adds up to a lot of time. Furthermore, there is also the price of the stainless steel replacement hardware. The good news is that regional climbing groups have shown adept at funding and completing such projects. The list includes numerous recognizable locations, such as Boulder, Rifle, the New, the Red, Rumney, Yosemite, and Joshua Tree. Disappointingly, hundreds
