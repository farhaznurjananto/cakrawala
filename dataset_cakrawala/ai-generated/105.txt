For more than a decade, efforts to decrease the number of cases of HIV in the United States have focused on four specific groups: black men who have sex with men (MSM), Hispanic MSM, black women and women of color, and injection drug users.

Beginning in 2011, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started to see a sharp increase in the number of new HIV infections. The majority of new infections were occurring in young black MSM.

In response, the CDC launched the first-ever national prevention campaign specifically targeted at black MSM. The campaign, called "Start Talking. Stop HIV.," urges black MSM to talk openly about HIV with their sexual partners, get tested for HIV, and know their status.

The campaign includes television, radio, and online ads, as well as outreach in black gay bars and clubs.

In 2013, the CDC released new data showing that the rate of new HIV infections had declined among black MSM. The decline was attributed, in part, to the success of the "Start Talking. Stop HIV." campaign.

Despite these successes, the number of new HIV infections continues to increase among black MSM. The CDC is currently working on a new national HIV prevention campaign called "Know Your Status. Stay Alive." The campaign will focus on increasing HIV testing among black MSM and other vulnerable populations.

The "Start Talking. Stop HIV." campaign is one of several strategies the CDC is using to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the United States. Other strategies include increasing access to HIV testing and treatment, encouraging safe sexual practices, and targeting interventions to high-risk groups.

The "Know Your Status. Stay Alive." campaign is expected to be launched in 2018.
