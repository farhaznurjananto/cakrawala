Dear Editor: In his entertaining article "Auguring Well" (Jan. 21), William Safire talked about how the President can "swear" or "affirm" that he will do his job. Mr. Safire made a mistake when he said, "Of the 40 men who have taken that oath, only Herbert Hoover chose "affirm."" Franklin Pierce, our 14th President, chose to "affirm" instead of "swear" when he took the oath of office. Benjamin, his 11-year-old son, died in a train accident about two months before Pierce took the oath. This is why Pierce did what he did. Pierce thought that his sins caused his son to die, so he did not read from the Bible at his inauguration. For this action, "affirm" had to be used instead of "swear."
