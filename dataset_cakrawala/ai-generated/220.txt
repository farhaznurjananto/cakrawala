Jurors in Cleveland have gone beyond the decision to acquit Demrick McCloud, who had been charged with leading a gang of teens who beat a fellow student and threatened him with a gun in October of last year. Some of the jurors intend to donate their $100 stipend to McCloud if he earns a high school equivalency degree. Ana Boe, one of the jurors, highlights the small amount of money as “just a little carrot that goes to his future.” McCloud had been in jail since his arrest that night waiting for trial. The trial concerning charges of kidnapping and felonious assault that he had faced began on January 31st this year. 

Most of the jurors could not be reached for comment, although three jurors cited a “sheer lack of evidence”. They called the entire case against McCloud unsubstantial and said that the prosecution’s case hinged on the victim identifying McCloud as an attacker. The victim has told police that he was certain another boy was one of the assailants, but he was reportedly found to be in school at the time of the attack. 

As they were leaving the court, three jurors discussed how they could help McCloud. They committed to donating their jury stipend to a fund for McCloud. Boe noted that the amount donated would be too small to compensate McCloud for his time in jail. However, the gesture would indicate they show him support. The three jurors have also considered writing letters of complaint to Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath and Fourth District Commander Deon McCaulley about what they found to be a lack of a thorough investigation. Other jurors are also planning to do the same. 

Spokesmen for Cleveland Police and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason have declined to comment on the plan, as well as on several complaints from the jurors about the case, although Mason said in a written statement that ‘the victim was steadfast in his positive ID of McCloud, whom he recognised as someone he knew from the neighbourhood’. Mason also highlighted that the defendant maintained that he was not involved in the crime, and the case eventually went to trial. 

The jury, who deliberated for only 30 minutes, did not believe that an attack occurred. They identified several key issues such as a lack of medical records of injuries from the attack, no testimony of a search for the gun, or verification that the victim had been let out of school early, as he testified. They also highlighted that the attacking teens did not take the victim's phone, iPod, or money and that the victim could not identify the exact location of the attack, even though it happened in front of his house. 

McCloud's mother, Sonia, praised her son’s lawyer, Kevin Spellacy. Sonia McCloud stated that she was “startled” at the thought of donating the money and added that her son intended to resume his education. She also reiterated what the jurors said, accusing the police of not investigating the case fully.
