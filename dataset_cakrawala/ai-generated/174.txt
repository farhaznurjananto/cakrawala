Nate Parker brings the story of Nat Turner to the screen with a film that is passionate, stirring and important, but also flawed.

Chloe Sevigny and Mark Ruffalo play Turner's slave owners, who are as cruel as they are caring. The film chronicles Turner's life from his childhood, when he was sold to the Sevigny's, to his young adulthood, when he became a preacher and began to question the institution of slavery.

Parker's film is intense and often brutal, but it's also a powerful and important story that needs to be told. The film is not perfect, but it's an important and powerful work. Sevigny and Ruffalo give excellent performances, and Parker's direction is excellent. This is a film that is not to be missed.
