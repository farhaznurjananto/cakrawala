SARAH FERGUSON, PRESENTER: After a series of scandals, the live animal export trade is supposed to be enjoying a boost, with strong support from the new government and the recent reopening of key markets in the Middle East. 
  But now there are allegations that some rogue traders may be putting the whole industry at risk.  
 A 7.30 investigation has discovered a trail of paperwork suggesting export documents may have been falsified, flouting strict national and international laws designed to protect countries from importing diseased animals. 
  We've also uncovered evidence that one of Australia's biggest exporters may be breaching the system set up just three years ago to protect Australian animals overseas. 
  The Australian Department of Agriculture is now investigating these allegations and has formally requested 7.30 hand over evidence obtained for this story.  Matt Peacock has this exclusive report with several conflicting images. 
 
 MATT PEACOCK, Correspondent: This month Australian livestock are moving back to Bahrain and Egypt after a long and controversial trade halt. 
 But now, 7.30 has exposed possible criminal activity at the heart of the industry. There is evidence  that key export documents were forged. 
 MELISSA PARK, Fremantle Labor MP: I believe that all powers of  law should apply in cases where a document is falsified. This is a criminal matter. WITH PICK
