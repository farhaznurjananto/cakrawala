Texas has come to a close on its 2014 Democratic and Republican primary runoff elections. Early voting began on May 19, culminating in the selection of six candidates who will advance to November's general election.

Republicans held four contested ballots:
1. Lieutenant Governor nominee - State Sen. Dan Patrick claimed victory over incumbent David Dewhurst. 
2. Attorney General nominee - State Sen. Ken Paxton defeated State Rep. Dan Branch.
3. Agriculture Commissioner nominee - Sid Miller won against former State Rep. Tommy Merritt.
4. Railroad Commissioner nominee - Oil and gas consultant Ryan Sitton trumped former State Rep. Wayne Christian.

Meanwhile, Democrats voted in two contests:
1. U.S. Senate nominee - David Alameel defeated outsider Kesha Rogers.
2. Agriculture Commissioner nominee - Jim Hogan secured a win against entertainer Kinky Friedman.

With November's election in sight, State Sen. Dan Patrick looks forward to expanding support for his candidacy. Addressing his supporters in Dallas, Patrick expressed his commitment to American values and revealed plans to campaign in Democratic strongholds. This strategy garnered a response from Democratic Lt. Gov. nominee Leticia Van De Putte, who stated that her focus will remain on "smart business decisions" for Texas.

In other election news, 91-year-old U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall was defeated by Republican primary challenger John Ratcliffe, and Republican State Board of Education member Pat Hardy triumphed over a Tea Party opponent without any educational or school administration experience. Finally, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst conceded defeat and expressed his support for Dan Patrick in the upcoming election.
