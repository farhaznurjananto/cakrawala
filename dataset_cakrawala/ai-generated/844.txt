 What is Mix and Mega? 
  In short, Mix and Mega is a metagame where his fully evolved OU legal Pokémon can hold all the Mega Stones. Mega-evolving gains stats, modifications, new typings (if applicable), and abilities that the stone grants to its original owner. For example,  Altarianite gives her Altaria her base stats of 75/110/110/110/105/85, grants it her second Fairy type, and changes its ability to her Pixilate. This means a +40 attack, +20 defense, and  +40 special attack. So if you give Landorus-T  Altarianite, his base stats will be his 89/185/110/145/80/91, he'll be a Ground/Fairy type, and he'll gain Pixilate.

You can mega evolve as many times as you want. The boost continues until the Pokémon faints.  Red  and Blue Orbs will now activate immediately, just like Groudon and Kyogre. If a Mega Stone raises any of a Pokémon's base stats above 255 or below 0, that Pokémon cannot use it.As such, Shackle cannot use Subrenite. Because her speed is below her 0 and her defense and special defense are above 255. 
 However, there are some prohibitions. Kangaskhanite is prohibited outside of Kangaskhan.  Beedrillite, Mawilite, and Medichamite are
