100 yo-yos! Yes! I agree with you that it's really a completely arbitrary step AND many of these posts have incorporated two or even three yo-yos at once, but regardless... obviously I'll accept any chance to feel excited about yourself. Actually, it's important to me. I started this blog with my first tom kuhn 3-in-1 no jive yo-yo, and even though I've browsed through a lot of other great pieces in my collection, this is still  the best. biggest product. it's nothing special, it's a bit off-beat and to be honest, it's  hard to get him to do "cool stuff". Anyway, it turned out to be the yo-yo I threw when I started my own style (whatever it was). I really loved the  simplicity and no-frills modesty of the antics from the very first throw. and since then, I've worked intermittently to put my own stamp on it (both metaphorically and now, physically). I tried hitting some hard stuff on it. I tried to think of new moves that worked for its limitations, rather than in spite of them. and I've amassed a pretty amazing collection of carefree variations (my wife would probably say it's morbid). this earns 75. for anyone starting out in yo-yoing, there will be this model that  you consider "classic". usually it will be one of the first models  you come across - maybe the imperial one you first saw at toys r us or the black magic you saw in the first video
