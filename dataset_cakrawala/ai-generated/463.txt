Prime Minister Tony Abbott's proposal to revoke sole Australian citizenship from individuals implicated in terrorism has encountered strong resistance within his cabinet. The proposal has been criticized for potentially violating international law by removing a person's citizenship without due process and possibly rendering them stateless. As per the proposal's stipulations, the only safeguard against leaving an Australian stateless would be to ensure that they are eligible to apply for another country's citizenship, regardless of their current dual citizenship status. Notably, a related proposal allowing the removal of Australian citizenship from dual citizens under suspicions of terrorism has been accepted.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop raised concerns regarding the potential difficulties imposed on individuals seeking citizenship in another country after being stripped of their Australian citizenship due to terrorism suspicions. Attorney-General George Brandis, who was present at the cabinet meeting, reportedly affirmed his commitment to the rule of law, stating, "I am the Attorney-General. It is my job to stand for the rule of law." Furthermore, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce questioned the necessity of the proposal, asking, "Isn't that what we have courts for?"

Owing to the discord within the cabinet's national security committee, the proposal was included only as part of a "discussion paper" and was not put forth as a proposed legislation. Several cabinet members expressed dissatisfaction with the non-adherence to standard protocol, as the six-page discussion paper had not been circulated in advance.
