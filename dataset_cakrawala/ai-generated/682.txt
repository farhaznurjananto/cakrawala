The unchecked power of the US government has, in the past, led to the extra-judicial killing of an American citizen - a 16-year-old child caught in a drone strike targeting his father. The administration labeled the death as a mistake; however, due process should have prevented such a tragedy from occurring. Despite this horrific incident, the American assassination program continues unabated.

Domestically, the prison industry and the war on drugs have turned the nation into one plagued by racial disparities and inhumane treatment of prisoners. The United States has the highest incarceration rate globally, with overcrowded prisons and extensive use of solitary confinement. Hunger strikes and force-feeding, reminiscent of the situations in Guantanamo Bay, have occurred in Californian prisons, with prisoners fighting for their human rights.

These forms of cruel treatment amount to torture, and the war on drugs - a key factor in this abuse - remains a politically untouchable issue. It sustains the prison-industrial complex and contributes to the nation's systemic issues.

The American healthcare system, while providing essential services, significantly benefits insurance companies, which contributes little to the overall chain of care. Furthermore, patients' medical treatment options are often influenced by pharmaceutical industry schemes and a highly exploitative patent system. This restrictive intellectual property system inhibits the progress of research and access to crucial technology and treatment for countless people.

The driving force behind these issues is not necessarily power but money. Financial gain is the goal of America's elite, with cash flow dictating everything from drug enforcement policies to global supply chains. Unfortunately, the majority of people do not benefit from this pursuit of profit, as debt and financial burdens plague citizens while only a select few prosper.

As for political and social reform, activism across the entire political spectrum has proven largely unsuccessful. Corruption and an unresponsive government have rendered most grassroots movements ineffective, leading to a society dominated by kleptocracy.

Political protest has become nothing more than pure spectacle without any real-world consequences. Speech and expression are celebrated as long as they do not threaten the status quo or challenge the kleptocratic system in any meaningful way.

Americans are some of the most hardworking people globally; however, they also endure significant levels of personal debt due to the high costs of education and healthcare. Obligation and financial insecurity constrain individual freedoms and inhibit the majority of citizens from taking risks or pursuing change.

In conclusion, America has morphed into a kleptocracy run by powerful corporations and entities. The good people of the nation are kept divided and at odds with each other to prevent challenges to this exploitative system, ultimately leading to an array of social, economic, and political consequences.
