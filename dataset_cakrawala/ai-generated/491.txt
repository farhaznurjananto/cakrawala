New data from Western Australia's Department of Health reveals an alarming decline in the uptake of the flu vaccine, despite the high risk of influenza's potentially severe consequences. Last year, 7,937 confirmed influenza cases were recorded in Western Australia, with 20% (1,580) of those requiring hospitalisation due to the severity of their symptoms.

The most at-risk demographic, those aged 65 and over, represented 22.5% (1,788) of total flu cases. Out of this cohort, 23% (722) required hospitalisation for their symptoms. Worryingly, the uptake of the flu vaccine in this demographic was 56% in 2016, which is a significant drop compared to the 64.2% uptake in 2014.

These concerning findings follow a study led by Princess Margaret Hospital infectious diseases specialist Christopher Blyth, which discovered that the vaccination rate for the under-five age group had fallen from around 42% in 2008-09 to a mere 7% in 2010-14.

According to Health Minister Roger Cook, the decline in the number of people getting the influenza vaccine is a startling trend that is unnecessarily endangering the health of the public. Cook emphasised the importance of getting vaccinated against the flu every year, as the previous year's vaccine may not provide protection against the current year's viruses, and protection may wane after three to four months.

Moreover, Cook highlighted that now is the best time to be vaccinated to ensure maximum protection for the flu's peak season in August and September. He added that hospital Emergency Departments face extra pressure during the peak flu season due to the influx of patients presenting with flu and flu-like symptoms.

The influenza vaccine is available free to eligible at-risk groups, including young children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, pregnant women, individuals aged 65 and above, and those with chronic medical conditions. People who are ineligible for the free vaccine can receive it through their GP or a participating chemist for a small fee.

It is highly recommended for anyone concerned about whether they or their family members should be vaccinated to discuss the matter with their GP. Being informed about the flu vaccine and acting in a timely manner can go a long way in safeguarding oneself and their loved ones from this highly contagious disease and its potentially serious complications, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory disease, which can lead to hospitalisation or even death.
