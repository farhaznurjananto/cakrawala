San Francisco has long had a requirement that large new developments in the downtown area must include public open spaces (POPOS) proportional to the size of the property. However, this has not been easy to enforce, and several developments have been "Scrooge-like" with their POPOS offerings. 

Some of the best POPOS in downtown San Francisco are tricky to find. They may be on upper-floor terraces or hidden in the interior plazas of office buildings. However, part of their charm comes from their unique blend of the intimacy usually found in private spaces combined with office-quality amenities like leather chairs and potted olive trees.

Recently, the city has revealed a new web tool to catalog and detail the various POPOS, including amenities and accessibility information. The updated ordinance also requires clearer signage both inside and outside the buildings, plus no private events in public spaces. This comes more than 25 years since the 1985 downtown plan, originally created to open up private buildings to public use. 

The aim of the ordinance update is to make POPOS more public-friendly, so citizens feel comfortable using them for a quiet lunch break, a reading nook, or even the toilet. Many buildings were found to be non-compliant with the 1985 plan and will need to revamp their POPOS to adhere to updated requirements. All new developments must also meet updated standards. The new web tool even includes templates and design guidelines for signage that designate amenities like restrooms, food, and seating availability.

Despite San Franciscans being encouraged to use these spaces, many may still feel uneasy about exploring a building where they don't have business or a room. This is compounded when food vendors add to the intimidation factor. However, access to POPOS is every citizen's right, as much as a public park, and the new ordinance should help clarify and encourage exploration of these spaces.
