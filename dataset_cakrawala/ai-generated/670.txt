A Kissimmee police officer, Sgt. Bruce Connors, aged 36, has been charged after crashing into an employee's car in the parking lot of a Brevard County strip club and fleeing the scene. Connors was charged in early October with leaving the scene of a crash after colliding with the car parked outside the Lido Cabaret in Cocoa Beach. He was relieved of duty on October 30 and placed on paid administrative leave. Connors, who joined the department in 2004, earns $66,000 a year.

The department has initiated an internal affairs investigation into the incident. Police Chief Lee Massie declined to comment on the case. Surveillance footage of the crash shows an employee of the strip club, dressed in a thong and corset, chasing after Connors' pickup truck moments after he rammed her 1965 Oldsmobile Cutlass sedan on October 9 and sped away.

The club already had Connors' information since he had been drinking there a week earlier and left without paying his tab. The club has a policy that requires patrons running a tab to hand over a credit card and driver's license until the bill is settled. Officer manager Vanessa Castillo provided investigators with a photocopy of Connors' driver's license, which identified his home address as the Kissimmee Police Department.

Videos released by the Brevard-Seminole State Attorney's Office show Connors and two friends leaving the club shortly before the crash. Connors was seen kicking off his sandals and shadow boxing barefoot on the pavement before getting back into his truck. After sitting for a minute, he put the pickup in gear and immediately struck the classic car parked next to him, the video shows.

A Brevard County Sheriff's investigator described the footage, stating that "The defendant struck the Oldsmobile, stopped, changed the direction of his front wheels, drove further continuing to strike. The defendant stopped for a moment, then fled the scene." Jessica Bruce, 27, the car's owner and a bartender at the strip club, witnessed the event and began chasing after Connors' pickup truck as it briefly stopped at an intersection before speeding away. The sheriff's office reported noticeable damage to the Cutlass' front bumper, hood, driver's side fender, and wheel well.

Connors was advised of his Miranda rights to remain silent and told the crash investigator that "he was driving, struck the vehicle that was next to him and he fled the scene." In January, Connors had received his agency's employee-of-the-month award. Records state that "Connors has distinguished himself within the department by proving that he is a hardworking, strong leader and team player. His can-do attitude and willingness to help is second to none. He is a true team player and great leader, who displays a high degree of dedication to his position and his department."
