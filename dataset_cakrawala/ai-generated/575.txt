The established moderate politicians are feeling threatened as populist movements on both sides of the Atlantic generate widespread support. The middle-class, middle-of-the-road technocrats who have dominated politics for the last three decades now face a surge of people power from those who are tired of being patronized and treated as problems to be solved. This can be seen with the rise of Donald Trump and increasing support for Euroscepticism.

In the US, the American elite's contempt has driven many voters to support Trump as a refreshing alternative. The belief among the new political elites that they are superior to the rural, the old, and the religiously inclined has transformed politics into something that should be done for the people's own good rather than by the people according to their values. 

In the UK, moderate politicians are concerned about the EU referendum, where ordinary people will have their say on Britain's future relationship with the EU. The backlash against the EU is not due to xenophobia as some have claimed, but rather exhaustion with the ossified oligarchy of the Brussels machine. People want to regain control over their lives and destinies, especially among those who are less well-educated and who are tired of being treated as welfare recipients by the new political elites.

The emergence of this people power has injected energy into what had become a flat, lifeless sphere of politics over the past two decades. These movements are disrupting and challenging the status quo, causing the political and media elite to question their previous assumptions and consider the views of the masses.
