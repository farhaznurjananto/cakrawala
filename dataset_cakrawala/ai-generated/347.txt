Religion, politics and society have always been intertwined in one way or another. Many have dared to challenge the traditional and conservative beliefs and attitudes that have been in place for centuries, especially when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights. The American Family Association, a notorious anti-gay hate group, has made headlines once again, and not for the right reasons. In a recent column for the group, Michael Youssef, a leader of the religious right, stated that the Episcopal Church is no longer Christian because it is accepting of gays.

The Episcopal Church has always been a prolific institution known for its unique approach to traditional Christianity. However, Youssef disagrees, claiming that the Church is actually defying God, simply by showing tolerance to the LGBTQ+ community. The Church's acceptance of homosexuality is perceived, by Youssef at least, as a failure to adhere to the values of Christianity, and ultimately, rendering the Church unchristian.

The tipping point for Youssef came in 2011 when a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, M. Thomas Shaw, performed a lesbian marriage ceremony at St. Paul's Cathedral in Boston. According to Youssef, this culminated in the dilution of the core beliefs of the Episcopal Church, its values, and its fundamental religious identity.

In that very same year, the Episcopal Church declared a "moratorium" on the "ordaining, marrying, and uniting and blessing" of same-sex couples. But according to Youssef, this was just a surface-level agreement, and the Church had already been accepting of same-sex marriage long before the moratorium was put in place.

One of Youssef's main objections is that the acceptance of homosexuality in the Episcopal Church is a violation of the "created order," and the religious leader maintains that marriage was designed to be between one man and one woman. He subscribes to a belief ingrained in traditional Christian beliefs that are not ready to adapt to evolving times.

However, Youssef's assertion that the Episcopal Church is no longer a Christian denomination because it accepts homosexuality is controversial. It highlights the significant gap between traditional Christian beliefs and the progressive beliefs that many religious organizations and their members are putting forward. Many Christians argue that the strength of their faith lies in embracing everyone, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, just as Jesus accepted and embraced all people.

In conclusion, the discourse surrounding the LGBTQ+ community within religious institutions such as the Episcopal Church is highly controversial. There is no doubt that opinions will remain divided, but ultimately, we should all strive to move forward together with love and acceptance for all.
