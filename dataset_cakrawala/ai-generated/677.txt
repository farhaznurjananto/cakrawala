India's Dalit leader, Mayawati, has called on the Australian government to commit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to a "mental asylum" following leaked US cables revealing that the politician sent an empty jet to Mumbai to collect a pair of sandals. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, notorious for her lavishness and self-importance, was enraged by the October 2008 WikiLeaks cable titled "Portrait of a Lady," which also alleged that her concerns over security led her to hire food tasters.

Rather than directing her anger towards the US embassy, she targeted the Australian-born WikiLeaks chief, accusing him of being anti-Dalit. Mayawati stated, "The owner of WikiLeaks has gone mad, or he has joined hands with our opposition parties to malign my government." She continued, "I request the government of his country to send him to a mental asylum, and in case they are all full, I will make space for him in the mental asylum in Agra."

Assange responded by suggesting Mayawati had "betrayed rational thought." He demanded an apology and encouraged her to voice her complaints to then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, he also mentioned that after being under house arrest in the UK for 272 days, he "would be happy to accept asylum, political asylum, in India â€“ a nation I love." He added, "In return, I will bring Mayawati a range of the finest British footwear."

Mayawati, the Chief Minister of India's most populous and one of its poorest states, is revered by millions of low-caste Dalits, formerly known as Untouchables.
