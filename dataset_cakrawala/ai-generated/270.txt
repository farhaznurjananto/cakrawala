In 2003, former congressman Patrick Toomey proposed an amendment to revoke funding for five grants, four of which examined sexual behavior. This led to a congressional investigation, which listed 250 grants by 157 scientists, most of which were for studies on sexual behavior and drug use. As a result of this controversy, many of the principal investigators subsequently used less-controversial language and, in some cases, changed the focus of their research to avoid such areas altogether.

Joanna Kempner, a sociologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, conducted a study on the aftermath of the political debate surrounding the work based on data from the period. Of the 82 principal investigators who participated in the survey, half were changing the language of their grants and papers to disguise aspects of their research. The scientists would modify or delete 'red flag' language such as bisexual, lesbian, or sexual intercourse to make their grants more 'politically viable'.

The study suggests that perceptions of the ideological climate lead scientists to try to avoid research projects that they think will not be funded or which will stop them from receiving funding in the future. It also shows that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is not immune to political interference, despite being an institution that should be insulated from political influence. The study highlights how the NIH has been "tarnished by the Bush administration's pursuit of ideological purity instead of effective science," according to Peter Bearman, a sociologist at Columbia University in New York.

The results also reveal that about a quarter of the respondents no longer studied such topics. Four scientists even chose to change careers as a result of the political turmoil, Kempner said. Changing and deleting red-flag language probably doesn't harm an individual scientist's grant, though it could slow the progress of science, says Angela Sharpe, deputy director for health policy at the Consortium of Social Science Associations, an advocacy group based in Washington DC.

However, the study has limitations. It examines a single event, and the sample group might be biased toward those who are willing to talk about the incident and its effects. Kempner thinks that the "chilling effect" on research could be even more profound than her survey suggests.

The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world. Still, the controversy surrounding the funding of certain studies highlights the extent to which politics will always be involved in its funding process. However, in this case, the study suggests that research may have been compromised as scientists have avoid research projects they believed would not be funded or would prevent them from receiving funding in the future.
