How can I give the image a more human touch? is a question that frequently enters my mind when I am creating architectural images. Almost always, Photoshop texturing is the solution. I have spent the past week illustrating a bird's-eye view for my most recent personal project. For this particular piece, I wanted to test what would happen if I applied a heavy texture to nearly every surface of the image. There were a number of details that I would ordinarily overlook in other illustrations, but not in this one. The end result is an image with age-related flaws. Base Rendering It can be difficult to avoid "tiling" of textures in 3D environments, despite the importance of texture mapping. Frequently, my foundation renderings appear flat and "perfect," meaning the texture is flawless. This is because I have limited control over bump maps and texture characteristics. At some point, time spent texturing in a 3D scene might be accomplished considerably more quickly in Photoshop. After creating so many illustrations over the years, I am beginning to understand that threshold and when I must go from 3D to 2D post-processing. To achieve the desired aesthetic, I frequently require both a decent texture in the 3D model and a nice texture in Photoshop. Texture Zones I focused on four aspects for this illustration: the surrounding context's rooftops, the textures of my design, the roadways, and the sidewalks/landscape. All four of these regions are interdependent, and if one is left untreated, the "plastic" feel of the computer is shown and the impression is lost. Selecting Textures Many photographs of asphalt roads were utilized to create textures to my illustration in Photoshop. They have the appropriate amount of grime and flaws and can be used in locations other than streets. In this instance, I applied asphalt textures to the rooftops of the buildings and, after decreasing their opacity, even to the concrete and brick sidewalks. Before And after textures Prior-to-After Comparison A side-by-side comparison demonstrates how effective Photoshop texturing can be. I've realized that components such as roads and rooftops, which I frequently observe artists ignoring in their illustrations, make a significant impact in giving an image a human touch. Including these minor flaws begins to convince the viewer that the image is not computer-generated. The Last Image Using the use of orange color overlays, I warmed up the hues in this final image. Using plugins such as Topaz Labs Adjust, I enhanced the detail and clarity of a number of my illustrations. Typically, I disable perspective for aerials, but in this case I left it on and enlarged the field of view in SketchUp to make the structures appear higher. The perspective is effective because it attracts attention to the image's center and highlights the design. All photographs were taken by Alex Hogrefe.
