Six federal bureaucrats were drafted to work on the project, including Michael Pitts-Singer, a senior scientist for the U.S. Forest Service on the Research and Development team in Fort Collins, Colorado.

He and his colleagues were tasked with creating a single database that would house information on more than 100,000 plants in the western United States.

“The western states have this huge diversity of plants. It was just a mess,” Pitts-Singer said. “They had all of this data that was not in digital form, and it was in different formats, and it was in different places.”

They had one year to complete the project.

It was a daunting task for the group of federal employees, who were not used to working in the private sector. They had to learn how to write software code and how to secure funding from outside the government.

“We had to go through a learning curve of what it means to be a startup,” Pitts-Singer said.

The team was able to build the database in just six months.

The project was a success, and the team was able to secure funding from the National Science Foundation to continue their work.

“It was a really big undertaking, but it was a great learning experience,” Pitts-Singer said.

Now, the database is used by researchers all over the world.

“It’s saved a lot of time and a lot of money,” Pitts-Singer said.

The federal employees who worked on the project are now working in the private sector. Pitts-Singer is now a senior director at a software company in Colorado.

“It was a great experience, and I think it prepared me well for the private sector,” he said.

The project is a reminder that even though federal employees are typically hired for their experience and expertise in government, they can also use that skillset to succeed in the private sector.

“It’s just a great example of how government can work with the private sector to solve a problem,” Pitts-Singer said.
