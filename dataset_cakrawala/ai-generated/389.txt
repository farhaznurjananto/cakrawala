A recent hearing at the High Court of Justice focused on a petition related to the egalitarian prayer area at the Western Wall, or Kosel, in Jerusalem. The unusual twist was that the request came from minority “religious” women who are not affiliated with the Women of the Wall (WoW) group. These women argued that they should be allowed to bring Sifrei Torah into the Ezrat Nashim area of the Kosel. Their petition was filed against the Kosel Rav Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who has refused to grant them permission to do so.

During the court hearing, the petitioners went even further, requesting that the mechitza (the separation marker between men and women) be removed from the Western Wall completely. They contended that if some chareidim insist on a separate area, the dividers could be placed in certain designated areas at certain times of the day only to accommodate prayer. Justice Elyakim Rubinstein asked Rabbi Rabinowitz for his input, but he proposed the existing prayer area at Robinson’s Arch. The women immediately rejected this alternative, insisting that they have the right to pray at the Western Wall itself and should not be required to settle for a nearby site.

The petitioners also charged that Rabbi Rabinowitz is exceeding the authority of his position by not allowing them to bring Sifrei Torah into the area. The justices decided that they would like to hear from the Chief Rabbis of Israel and the Attorney General, Avichai Mandelblit, before rendering a final decision on the petition.
