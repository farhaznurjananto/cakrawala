The Polish Embassy in the United States and the Foreign Ministry of Poland have expressed their concerns regarding statements made by FBI Director James Comey, in which he appeared to attribute responsibility for Holocaust crimes to Poland, Hungary, and Germany. 

In a column published in the Washington Post, Comey said, "In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn’t do something evil. They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That’s what people do. And that should truly frighten us.” The column was adapted from a speech he delivered at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's 2015 National Tribute Dinner.

Comey's speech emphasized the importance of understanding the large-scale abuse of authority that occurred during the Holocaust. He stated that by sending new FBI agents to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, he aims to expose them to the darker aspects of humanity and to teach them about the consequences of unchecked power.

However, his comments have been met with substantial disapproval in Poland. Deputy Foreign Minister Rafał Trzaskowski found Comey's statements unacceptable, stating that "The Polish State always responded and will always respond [to such comments]." He further explained that the Polish Embassy had promptly sent a letter to the FBI Director, clarifying the historical realities surrounding Poland's involvement in the Holocaust.

Trzaskowski also noted that Poland actively addresses any accusations made in foreign press that misrepresent its role during the Holocaust period.
