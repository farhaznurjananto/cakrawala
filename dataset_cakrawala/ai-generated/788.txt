The concept of tactical yoga pants has always piqued my interest. Since 5.11 introduced the concept at SHOT Show, several women have asked me to put them through their paces. The company sent me a pair that were simply wrapped in plastic and labeled with the size (small) and color ("Tundra"). It's not like a product called "Raven Range Tights" (RRT) requires a flashy presentation... The term "Tundra" refers to dark green in marketing. The pants have no tags. OpSec is king! I can go to a yoga class in my RRTs without drawing attention to my tacticoolosity. The 5.11 tights aren't as soft as most yoga pants, but they're definitely durable. The belt loops and waistband are stitched with parachute-like panache. The next step is to put them on. The tactical yoga pants are fitted from the knee down and looser at the top. It's a positive point, as I'll explain shortly. First and foremost, cardio... I concluded that the RRTs "sweat wick" as advertised after 30 minutes of strenuous exercise. I did an hour of yoga in the 5.11 tights later. I was mostly interested in their ability to allow for a range of motion, especially since the RTTs are not soft and the reinforced knee made me concerned about their flexibility. Mission accomplished once more. I didn't wear a belt while practicing yoga, but they didn't fall down. The next day, I put on my RRTs, grabbed my EDC, and went to the range. I pulled out my Rekkr Custom Kydex IWB concealment holster. I was able to tool-up as usual thanks to the RTT's industrial grade waistband and belt loops. After several draws, the tights remained comfortable and effective. Because they weren't too tight around my backside, I could move around while standing with my side arm in the waistband. As I previously stated, having more space is a good thing, not a bad thing. The RRTs, on the other hand, were not ideal for lounging around and relaxing with a hot cup of coffee after a day of working out and shooting. The seams are visible. RRTs, as snug as they are without being soft like yoga pants, are not my first choice for relaxation. Nonetheless, they were more comfortable than jeans or other work-appropriate pants. The Raven Range Tights from 5.11 aren't cheap at $89.99. However, they are prepared for TEOTWAWKI and add welcome style to range days without sacrificing utility. If you only buy one pair of tactical yoga pants, make it this one.

They stretched as needed and did not limit their movements when performing poses. a) a) b) c) d) e) e) e) e) e) These are now my go-to range pants. They're comfortable, sturdy, and loose in just the right places to accommodate my preferred IWB holster. Because the pants are so tight around the bottom, any pair of boots should go right over them.
