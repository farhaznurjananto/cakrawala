Real Salt Lake, a Major League Soccer team in the United States, earned their first win of the 2017 season in a match against the Vancouver Whitecaps. The victory came in a spring blizzard and marked Real Salt Lake's first win under their new coach, Mike Petke, in addition to being their first victory since August. The game was played under difficult conditions with large, wet snowflakes covering the pitch, causing both teams to make adjustments on the fly and play with tactics that were more suited for a schoolyard during recess. 

Despite the adverse weather conditions, Real Salt Lake played noticeably different and better with changes introduced by their coach, Mike Petke. The back line pushed higher up the field with Kyle Beckerman sitting back, allowing the attack to roam forward and float through the middle. This change proved to be effective as the team created several great opportunities in the first half but still had no goal to show for it. 

It was a nightmare scenario for spectators, who had seen the team botch chances in the past, usually accompanied by poor decisions or turnovers which would end up costing the team goals. However, it wasn't the same in this match. Real Salt Lake regrouped and scored three goals in the second half while still holding Vancouver scoreless. The first half might have ended goalless, but it was arguably the best half of soccer that the Real Salt Lake team has played since the 2014 season.

While it cannot be denied that Vancouver was without several key players, the win was still impressive for Real Salt Lake. The match proved to be a turning point for the team under their new coach, who had to grind out his debut in the difficult conditions. Petke's coaching paid dividends as the free-flowing attack created several great looks for RSL, who had eight first-half chances for a goal, none of which they were unable to finish. 

Overall, Real Salt Lake's victory was encouraging for both players and fans as the team looks to turn a new page and put last season's disappointments behind them. It was an impressive win for the team given the circumstances under which they had to play the match. With a new coach and a long season ahead of them, the Real Salt Lake team will be looking to build on this win and create a new momentum that will carry them forward in the season.
