Did you catch the latest buzz? The Avengers had a spectacular opening weekend in the US, raking in an astounding $207.4 million. It seems Disney accountants initially missed a pile of movie stubs, as the initial report valued the weekend at $200.3 million. As impressive as that is, let's not forget that the movie had already premiered internationally, amassing a whopping $447.4 million in just 12 days. Talk about being the talk of the town!

Warner Bros. were likely to cancel their celebratory bash for setting a debut record of $169.2 million last July with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2. After all, who would want to party in face of such a crushing defeat?

This doesn't come as a surprise, considering how universally appealing superheroes are. Harry Potter, on the other hand, is more generation-specific. Not to mention, The Avengers had a rich universe of beloved characters and stories to draw from, ensuring their widespread success.

Joss Whedon's expertise as a writer and director is not to be overlooked either. A captivating blend of intense emotion, suspense, and comic relief made The Avengers a truly satisfying experience. A stellar cast and strong character arcs, particularly for Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, were the cherry on top. Though heavily reliant on CGI, strong storytelling helped The Avengers avoid the fate of CGI-centric films like Wrath of the Titans.

It's also worth noting that higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings could have contributed to the film's impressive earnings. However, what's truly remarkable is that people were willing to spend the extra amount, given the bleak state of the economy. In Orange, CA, every IMAX seat, costing $16.50 - $18.50, sold out that weekend.

Maybe it's time for economists to take note â€“ and maybe it's time to enjoy The Avengers in IMAX.
