Meridian Police Ask Public for Help in Finding Missing Man

Meridian police issued a public appeal on Tuesday night for any information regarding the whereabouts of 55-year-old Mark Allen Rose. His Chevrolet pickup was reportedly discovered positioned along the Boise River when he failed to arrive for work on Monday morning.

At approximately 6:00 a.m., Rose left his Meridian home en route to his job assignment at Nampa. However, after not showing up for work, his family became worried and contacted the police to report him missing.

As they expressed their concern, Rose’s family told officials that he has been struggling with depression, a factor that led them to redouble their efforts in searching for him. The police issued an alert for Rose and his gray 2004 Chevrolet pickup with Plate number 1A8005X.

The Meridian police soon widened their search to areas near Boise River and notified the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office of Rose’s possible disappearance. A short while later, the authorities found the man’s vehicle at a sportsman’s access along the Boise River at 21319 Midland Boulevard.

Despite the use of a tracking dog, the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office in a statement, said that the dog “lost the scent after a short time”. This prompted the police to request the assistance of anyone with information about Rose’s whereabouts to come forward to aid in their search efforts.

Mark Allen Rose is described as 5ft 10 inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing khakis, a gray shirt and blue fleece jacket. If you have any information or had any contact with Rose on Monday, it is requested that you call the Meridian police at 888-6678.
