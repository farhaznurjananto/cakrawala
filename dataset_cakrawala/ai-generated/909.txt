Ed Sheeran announced that he will perform in Mumbai on November 19 just hours after the arrival of pop sensation Justin Bieber on Wednesday. Sheeran's official website published a post detailing his October and November tour dates in various Asian cities. The only Indian city on his list is Mumbai. Initially, Sheeran tweeted that he would visit India on April 1. Later, the tweet was removed from his feed, prompting some to speculate that he was simply thinking aloud. Sheeran's announcement comes at a time when the frenzy around Bieber's performance in India, part of his "Purpose" tour, has been immense. The 23-year-old was criticized for allegedly making excessive, Orientalist demands, and fans waited for hours at the airport before his arrival. Others have argued that his music is the only thing that matters and have paid outrageous prices for tickets.
