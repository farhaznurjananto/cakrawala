Q: Is there any method (aside from ingestion) to inform whether or not a substance is LSD? A: The most effective manner to definitively discover LSD is to do laboratory trying out of the material. However, there are  number one discipline exams to be had. The first is a chemical reagent take a look at called "Ehrlich's Reagent" that's to be had on-line from plenty of sources. It can discover indoles, of which LSD is one. It does now no longer definitively discover LSD, however can discover that LSD isn't gift.


The 2d is a UV take a look at primarily based totally at the reality that LSD fluoresces (glows) blue to blue-ish white below longwave (360 nm) UV light. Obviously different matters glow below blacklight as well, so simply the reality that it glows would not suggest it is LSD, however if it would not glow, LSD can usually be dominated out. The glow have to be obvious in each crystal shape and liquid shape.


Whether or now no longer this take a look at may be efficaciously used to discover whether or not LSD liquid is gift on different substances consisting of blotter or sugar cubes is extra complicated. In a darkish room, a blacklight held near a freshly laid, fairly strong (~a hundred ug) drop of LSD will glow prominently. However, if the awareness is low/vulnerable enough, the glow would not appear. Additionally, many papers and inks can themselves glow below blacklight, so a completely sparkling hit of blotter (in preference to a sparkling spot at the hit) would not always discover the presence of LSD. That way that it could be extra hard to discover blotter that has been dosed via way of means of dipping the paper as an alternative th
