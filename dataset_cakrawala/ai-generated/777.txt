The CDC states that the condition is not caused by an infection or anything in the environment.  
 The CDC study also included a lab analysis of skin fibers in Morgellons patients. The analysis showed that these fibers were mostly cotton, such as typically found in clothing or bandages. 
  CDC research also revealed that the skin sores seemed to be the result of long-term picking and scratching the skin.  
 The CDC report goes on to say: "We were not able to conclude, based on this study, whether this unexplained dermopathy represents a new condition, as has been proposed by those who use the term Morgellons, or wider recognition of an existing condition such as delusional parasitosis." 
 
 The results of the CDC study have been archived and are no longer updated.  CDC does not plan to conduct further research on this issue. 
 In addition to the CDC, other research groups have been involved in the morgelon debate. 
 Previous case studies and studies have suggested that Morgellon may be related to Lyme disease. Some patients with signs and symptoms of morgellons have tested positive for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.  
 But according to Morgellons, a researcher at Oklahoma State University, there is no evidence to support this theory. Similarly, there were no signs of Lyme infection in any of the people in the CDC study. 
  A 2010 study found a potential link between Morgellon's symptoms and an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). More research is needed to  investigate this further.
