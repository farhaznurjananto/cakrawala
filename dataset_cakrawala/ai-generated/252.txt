Global suppliers to electric car manufacturers, including Tesla, are scrambling to secure shipments of the key battery material cobalt, following the news that half a dozen hedge funds have established a large stockpile of the scarce metal. This includes Swiss-based Pala Investments and China’s Shanghai Chaos, who have purchased and stored an estimated 6,000 tonnes of cobalt, valued at up to $280m. This stockpile is equivalent to 17% of last year’s global production of the metal.

The investor groups have essentially built their bull-bets on the increasing use of batteries that contain chemical forms of cobalt by Chinese electric car manufacturers. These speculators are hoping to profit from the rising appetite for cobalt, which is known to significantly enhance the power of lithium-ion batteries. They are confident that electric vehicles will exceed current market expectations, causing the price of cobalt to rise, as battery makers such as Panasonic, which makes battery cells for Tesla, try to lock-up as much supply of the material as possible.

Commodity consultancy, CRU, estimates that global demand for cobalt will grow another 20% year on year, over the next five years, as a result of increased demand from the hybrid and electric car industries, where production grew by 41% last year. CRU predicts that demand for cobalt will outstrip supply by 900 tonnes this year alone. 

The price of cobalt has already jumped over 50% since November of last year, to $21 per pound, and could rise even higher, especially as the metal is almost entirely mined in Congo. In 2007, the price of cobalt peaked at around $50 a pound before dropping to $10 in 2015. Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Glencore, who controls almost a third of the cobalt market, said on Thursday that “there’s going to be bigger demand for cobalt” adding that each dollar rise in the price of cobalt generates around $55m in earnings for the company. 

It is understood that fellow hedge funds and end consumers have followed suit, making their own purchases in order to fill stock levels, changing the entire supply-demand equation. However, the funds could experience issues trying to sell the metal for a profit, as the cobalt market remains relatively small and new releases of supply could result in prices plummeting once more.

Around half of annual cobalt consumption comes from the electric vehicle industry. Although carmakers have been trying to reduce the amount used to improve battery stability and capacity, this has proven difficult. China is also helping to generate bullish predictions for demand, with electric vehicle manufacturers there starting to switch from batteries that didn't contain cobalt to ones that do; Goldman Sachs analysts believe that China’s use of cobalt in electric batteries will almost double by 2025. 

Cobalt's price hike has led some battery manufacturers to buy more cobalt in the spot market, leading to greater profits for the funds that have stockpiled the metal. In short, the news has completely shaken up the global cobalt market, and could have far-reaching implications for the electric vehicle industry.
