On June 26th, a Shenzhen Airlines Airbus A320, operating flight ZH-9041 and flying from Jinjiang to Hong Kong, experienced a near-collision with Lantau Island, as the aircraft went off course and flew below its minimum safe altitude during a go-around procedure. At the time of the incident, the Airbus A320 was on final approach to Hong Kong's runway 07L when the Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructed the crew to reduce their speed to the minimum approach velocity. The crew subsequently queried ATC about their separation from the previous traffic.

As the ATC was about to hand over the aircraft to the tower, the crew decided to initiate a go-around and declined the handoff. Due to a miscommunication between the aircraft and the ATC, the plane made an immediate right-hand climbing turn short of runway 07L/07R instead of following the standard missed approach procedure. This unplanned turn dangerously led the flight towards the mountainous terrain of Lantau Island, causing the aircraft to fly at an alarmingly low altitude.

In response to this precarious situation, the ATC quickly issued corrective instructions to aid the plane in reaching a safe altitude. The aircraft narrowly avoided colliding with the 3066 feet mountain peak of Lantau Island and climbed to safety at 6000 feet, completing a 360-degree turn in the process.

Following the incident, the aircraft followed appropriate missed approach procedures and eventually landed safely on runway 07L, approximately 20 minutes after initiating the go-around maneuver. A ground observer near the Buddha statue on Lantau Island captured a photograph of the aircraft as it narrowly avoided the mountains.

Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) has confirmed the occurrence of the incident and has since opened an investigation into the matter. They have also requested a formal report from Shenzhen Airlines. CAD believes the deviation from standard procedures was due to the crew mistaking instructions meant for another aircraft, leading to the off-course maneuver.

In the aftermath of the incident, the flight crew involved remains suspended while the investigation is ongoing. Shenzhen Airlines is taking proactive measures in response to the incident and is in the process of implementing immediate safety measures to improve pilot training and ensure flight safety on their routes to Hong Kong.
