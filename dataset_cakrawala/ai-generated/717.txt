Lindsey wonders how fast electrons move inside electrical cables. You might be surprised to learn that electrons move much slower through a typical copper wire than a turtle does. Each wire that conducts an electron flow and generates usable electric current is made up of billions of atoms. To move along it, electrons must traverse these atoms, randomly zigzagging their way, resulting in a slow net flow rate, known as "drift velocity," in a given direction. How slow is it exactly? We use the following formula to calculate it: I = n*A*v*Q or v = I/(n*A*Q) I is the current, n is the number of electrons per cubic meter, A is the wire cross-section, Q is the charge of an electron, and v is the electron drift velocity. Because the number of electrons in a copper wire (n) is 8.5 * 1028 per m3, and the charge of an electron (Q) is 1.6 * 10-19C, we can calculate the electrons' drift velocity if we also know the cross sectional area and the current. Assume you have a 14 amp current and a copper wire with a cross section of 3 * 10-6 m2. Plugging in all of the numbers yields an electron speed of 3.4 * 10-4 m/s, or about one-third of a millimeter per second. To put it into more concrete terms, this works out to about 1.2 meters (4.1 feet) per hour, which is much slower than the average box turtle, which can cover about 800 feet in the same amount of time. So how is it that something that is essentially slower than a turtle can turn on a light across a room almost instantly? A chain reaction has occurred. The atoms in the wire are crammed together cheek to jowl, which slows down the process but also puts the electrons in close proximity to one another. When the switch is turned on, a force is created to move the electrons, with each pushing its neighbor, who in turn pushes its neighbor, and so on all the way through the wire, thanks to the electrical potential difference created by the generator. As a result, while no electrons are flying through the wire to turn on the light, it appears to be the case. This is similar to how, when you turn on your faucet, water comes out immediately, despite the fact that your water source may be many miles away.
