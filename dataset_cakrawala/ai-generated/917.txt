 When I say cinnamon, do you mean sugar? Of course it's a popular combination. 
 However, those interested in cinnamon's health-boosting benefits should probably reconsider the spice. 
  For example, John Critchley, executive chef at Washington, D.C.'s Bourbon Steak restaurant, says why not add bourbon steak to your savory dishes? He uses cinnamon to make a spiced herb rab on rack of lamb. He also comes up with a wonderful spinach salad with raisins, pine nuts and cinnamon. 
  Critchley is a fan of the intense flavor of cinnamon, especially in Saigon. This is the cousin of Cassia he cinnamon variety most commonly used in the United States and Europe. And he says adding cinnamon to spice blends is a great way to layer flavor when  cooking.  
 And when you see the potential health benefits of spices, you're more and more motivated to try them in your kitchen.  Cinnamon is derived from tree bark. It has  been used as a medicinal plant since ancient times. There are several varieties that are harvested from southern China to Southeast Asia.
