A person in charge of adoption cases told detectives that Jaime Suzanne Ritchhart had given them paperwork saying she was pregnant and then signed a contract to give up her unborn child for adoption. A news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office says that the case manager also told detectives that the 31-year-old Ocala woman had gotten more than $7,100 from them so far. The manager also gave the detectives an official report that said Ritchhart hadn't gone to her doctor's appointments and had said she had a miscarriage. Then, a detective talked to Ritchhart, who allegedly said she was seven months pregnant and planning to give up her child for adoption in May. The release said that Ritchhart also told the detective that the adoption agency had been paying her rent. But when detectives showed Ritchhart medical records that showed she had a hysterectomy, she refused to talk and was arrested on charges of adoption fraud and grand theft, detectives said. According to records, this is Ritchard's 10th time being taken to the Marion County Jail. More FloriDUH
