What to do with opossums 
 
 A sweet, wild neighbor, the opossum is the only marsupial in our barn and  rarely commits more than "playing a game with a marsupial".

 Can be rapped. Often seen as pests and accused of everything from dumping trash to killing chickens, these silent marsupials are rarely a threat and are easily exterminated. 
 Common problems and solutions 
 
 Capable people are often accused, but rarely held responsible, for getting into the trash or the garden. They are definitely ready to stop  and clean up the mess left by other wayward creatures! They are often accused of killing chickens, which is very rare. Most people complain that opossums are just  there, not the trouble they cause.  Tolerance 
 
 Possibly non-aggressive: their open-mouthed defensive hisses are just a hoax to appear ferocious. And if that doesn't work, they'll fake their deaths when they're really scared! 
 
 If there's a marsupial in the garden, don't worry. They are not a threat and  they will most likely resume immediately. The best way to prevent them from visiting is to keep trash cans covered, don't leave  pet food overnight, and  remember to pick up fallen fruit  from trees. 
  But without a fuss, opossums can benefit your garden by eating snails, slugs, insects, and sometimes even small rodents. They will even clean up trash and fruit that fell on the tree.
