Itsdagram, the first all-inclusive Instagram application for Windows Phone, has taken the app world by storm with over 22,500 downloads and counting! In an interview with the app's visionary developer, Daniel Gary, he reveals the incredible success of Itsdagram, which amassed a whopping 12,000 downloads on its first day alone. The growth momentum continues with an astounding 3,500 new users daily. But wait, there's more: Gary plans to unveil a free, ad-supported version of the app, set to be released imminently! 

While the whispers of collaboration between Nokia and Microsoft have filled the air, a genuine, official Instagram app for the Windows Phone remains elusive. This is where Itsdagram comes to the rescue! Instagram has captured the hearts of celebrities who frequently share glimpses of their glamorous lives with legions of followers. Nokia acknowledges this huge demand and is committed to integrating this fan-favorite platform into their renowned Lumia devices. 

Itsdagram's phenomenal success doesn't stop there - it has skyrocketed to become the best-selling app in the Windows Phone Store within a week! The users have spoken, granting the app an impressive 4.5/5 rating from a vast pool of over 3,295 reviewers. Gary, the creative mastermind behind the app, diligently works to enhance Itsdagram by introducing innovative features such as private/public profile support, as well as the capability to approve or deny follow requests with ease. He is also tirelessly committed to improving the app by squashing bugs and resolving issues like aggravating repetitive notifications. 

If you think Itsdagram can't get any better, think again! The future holds exciting developments with version 1.8 currently undergoing thorough beta testing and preparing for its grand release. In his conversation with Neowin, Gary divulged his plans to expand Instagram's accessibility to a wider range of Windows Phone users with a new, free, and ad-supported version of Itsdagram. Anticipation is building as we eagerly await these upcoming enhancements to revolutionize the Instagram experience on Windows Phones!
