The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is one of the toughest and most popular mixed martial arts (MMA) events in the world. The sport has been growing in popularity, with millions of fans tuning in to watch the matches globally. The UFC 137 was one of the most anticipated events in the season until Sam Stout pulled out due to injury. However, with Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone stepping in as a late replacement, the fight against Dennis Siver promises to be an intriguing match-up.

Cerrone is a fighter with a difference, and he has repeatedly demonstrated his flexibility and preparedness. This will be the second time in his last three fights that he is replacing a fighter who has dropped out due to injury. Cerrone has won his last three consecutive fights since making his UFC debut, and his skills have improved significantly in each bout.

While Cerrone has been making significant strides, his opponent, Dennis Siver, is equally a force to be reckoned with. He hopes to add to his current four-match winning streak by taking on Cerrone. Siver is a veteran fighter with 24 wins and 11 losses, and he was supposed to face Stout before the latter pulled out.

Cerrone's last fight against the Brazilian fighter Charles Oliveira saw a quick first-round victory at the UFC on Versus 5 in Milwaukee. He made short work of his young opponent, delivering a stunning performance that showcased his ability to finish fights. Even before this fight, Cerrone had demonstrated his skillset in his victories over Paul Kelly and Vagner Rocha. In his debut UFC match, Cerrone was up against the ever-tough veteran fighter, Paul Kelly, who was fighting on home soil in Liverpool. However, he brilliantly adapts his tactics midway through the fight to win via submission.

With a 48-13-1 record, Cerrone is confident that he can deliver another win at UFC 137. He has a well-rounded striking game, and his grappling skills are formidable. Cerrone is respected within the sport for his ability to take risks and improvise during fights, a trait that has led him to several victories in the ring.

The UFC 137 event promises to showcase some of the best MMA fighters in the world. Along with the Cerrone vs Siver fight, Nick Diaz will face BJ Penn in the main event of the night. The UFC 137 is sure to bring some exciting fights, with many predicting an upset in the Cerrone vs Siver fight. Only time will tell who will come out on top, but this late replacement pairing has only added more intrigue to the UFC 137.
