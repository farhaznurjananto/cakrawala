Do you recall the tale of the trap door from the early days of Trapfinding? Several years and numerous levels later, that very same group has finally reached the trap and puzzle-themed level of the megadungeon. Their approach is just as sophisticated now as it was at Level 1.

So, there they were, trapped in a sinister crypt, relying solely on their wits and determination. The wizard was unavailable, the alchemist had fallen ill, and the cleric was occupied making scrolls in town. This meant that the party was filled with characters boasting high combat prowess but little in the way of intelligence.

As fate would have it, the party had recently come into possession of four adamantine glaives. Since the level is an ancient, long-forgotten tomb, there are no random encounters. This meant there were no penalties for making loud noises. As such, a group of hardened warriors began poking at walls, moving a few feet, and poking again. It was reminiscent of the opening scene of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" After ruining countless crypt walls, the party eventually discovered a genuine secret door.

"Eureka!" they exclaimed. (You could also compare their success to a broken clock being right twice a day.)

My dismay only grew as the subsequent dungeon section consisted of seemingly pointless winding corridors.

"Please, no," I sighed.

"Absolutely, yes!" the players shouted, quickly forming their synchronous glaive team once more.

For some bizarre reason, the group deduced that the hidden trap door must be in the ceiling. Lacking alternative tools, they decided to lie prostrate on the party's 10' x 10' flying carpet, occupying a 5' square each, and move along the ceiling one 10' square at a time. They thoroughly examined each square inch of the ceiling, a task taking at least 70 minutes. Coated in stone dust, with blisters forming on their hands, they were filthy, exhausted, and empty-handed.

Despite the players' enjoyment at watching me squirm, even they began to tire of these antics. The thought of repeating this process for each wall and the floor held little appeal.

"Is this even worth our time?" they pondered.

"Just consult the once-per-day divination item," someone suggested.

"I predict a high probability of success within the next half hour," announced the helpful construct.

So, with a mix of curses and prayers, the players resumed their laborious task. Time dragged on in the game, with the cavalier's gecko mount asleep and the diminutive gnome switching to a dagger when he realized the medium-sized glaive was too large for him. Covered in sweat and dirt, the group finally found the secret door, located 8 feet off the ground and nearly invisible from below. The Perception check to uncover it had a DC of 36, but even when taking 20, the highest anyone could achieve was 33. In my boundless mercy, I decided that the circumstance bonus from their synchronized glaiving efforts made up the difference. Besides, I was eager to continue with the actual adventure.

So, the question of the day: Have you ever solved a puzzle through brute force? What was your solution? Share your stories in the comments!
