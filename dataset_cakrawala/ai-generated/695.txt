Valve contacted me yesterday to inquire whether it was acceptable to showcase Papers Please in their demo video. While I appreciate them reaching out, it was not a necessary question. Currently, I am working on adding localization support to the game, a task that has proven more challenging than anticipated, mainly due to the extensive use of tiny pixel fonts and precise document layouts. Nonetheless, progress is being made.

My objective is to provide professional translations in French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and potentially Russian. Although I have received numerous offers for assistance, I believe there is a general underestimation of how time-consuming the translation process actually is. With over 10,000 words in the game, many of which are gameplay-critical and require cross-referencing, I have instead decided to begin with the localization tool's public release. This will enable fans to create translations more easily, package them, and distribute them for others to use.

Once localization is complete, I plan to write a full post-mortem on the game, documenting the various challenges and successes encountered during development. A more in-depth look at sales figures will also be included.

Papers Please has resonated with many players who appreciate the game's aesthetics and gameplay. To address some constructive feedback, I will look into adding more scripted events, moral choices, and a possible port of the game for multiple platforms such as iOS or Nintendo 3DS. In addition, I am considering the implementation of a postmortem event editor to expand the game further and create an even more immersive experience.

In developing the game's narrative and progression, I struggled with arranging the numerous encounters and mechanics into a cohesive and logical order. To overcome these challenges, I utilized a story layout tool to visualize how various events and mechanics would play out throughout the game.

Considering the game's initial release, improvements in the in-game economy were necessary to maintain continuous pressure on the player. Using custom tools, I was able to simulate different scenarios and adjust events and monetization accordingly. This enabled me to optimize the gameplay experience and add more engaging events to the game.

In conclusion, the ongoing development and improvement of Papers Please are a testament to the passion and dedication towards providing a continually engaging and immersive experience for players. Stay tuned for more updates about the game's future developments.
