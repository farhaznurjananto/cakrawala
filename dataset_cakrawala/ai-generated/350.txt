Nightclubs offer a unique experience that many individuals enjoy. However, not all of these establishments offer activities that cater to everyone's tastes. One club in particular, which remains unnamed, wanted to offer something different and unique that would attract a more sophisticated crowd.

Initially, the club projected classic films onto a plus-size stripper as part of a show, but they faced backlash from the audience. Afterward, the club had the girls perform to Sufjan Stevens songs, which still failed to attract the clientele they wanted. The owner then had an idea that transformed the club entirely. Instead of a typical showing, he handed out sketchpads to customers as they entered the venue, turned the performances into "art classes" that feature a nude model. Surprisingly, this idea worked, and the state permitted it, provided that the customers also had sketchpads in hand.

The new format appealed to a more cultured crowd, and the venue's reputation increased. The owner's simple, yet out-of-the-box thinking, converted an establishment known for its "boner-flexing tit parades" to a thriving "art class" that features a nude model.

In Japan, gambling is illegal, but pachinko parlors have found a way to circumvent the law. Pachinko is a game that resembles a combination of a slot machine and a pinball game that gives players steel balls instead of money as a reward. Since they reward players with goods instead of money, it isn't classified as gambling.

Following the game, players can trade the steel balls for a prize at an unmarked store. This store is often connected to the pachinko parlor, leading some individuals to believe that both facilities are owned by the same individuals. Although this provision has become widely known, it is unclear what the future holds, especially with the looming presence of the Yakuza.
