The CBS News Nearly five weeks after HealthCare.gov went live, the management expert who was brought in to fix the site says it can be fixed. But it won't take days, but weeks. Some Americans are surprised not only by the fact that they are being kicked off their current plans, but also by how much they have to pay for new ones. Special Section: The Start of Obamacare Many people's first experiences with the Affordable Care Act have been bad: a broken website, cancellation notices from insurance companies, and then sticker shock when they saw how much more expensive the new plans were. It goes against what the president has promised over and over again "Keeping your insurance plan is easy if you like it. No one will be able to take that from you." But people all over the country are finding out that Obamacare will make them lose their insurance plans because their old plans don't cover things like prenatal care and prescription drugs, which are required by the law. Kaiser Permanente dropped coverage for 160,000 people in California. At least 300,000 people in Florida are losing their health care coverage. That includes Dianne Barrette, who is 56 years old. She got a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield last month telling her that her current plan would end in January 2014. Barrette has a $54 monthly bill. She would have to pay $591 a month for the new plan, which is 10 times more than what she pays now. Barrette said, "I'm happy with what I have right now, and I just want to know why I can't keep it. Why do I have to do something different?" Jan Crawford of CBS News said on "CBS This Morning" that Barrette is eligible for some subsidies based on what HealthCare.gov says. But Barrette told CBS News that she doesn't know how much these subsidies would be because she can't get on the website. This is something that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will be asked about on Wednesday when she testifies on Capitol Hill. Over the weekend, technical problems kept going on, and on Sunday, Americans who tried to sign up were blocked from the website. HealthCare.gov has been shut down because of technical problems at a Verizon data center, according to the government. The Obama administration says it will take until the end of November, two months after the launch, to make HealthCare.gov work. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said on Sunday's "Face the Nation" that "the rollout has been a disaster," which is what most people in the U.S. have been saying for weeks. Shaheen said on Sunday about the deadline in November, "I hope you're right. We hear from a lot of people in New Hampshire who want to sign up for health insurance but can't because the website isn't working right." Watch the full report by Jan Crawford up top.
