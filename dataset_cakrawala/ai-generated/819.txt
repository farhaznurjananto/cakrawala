A new picture from Star Trek Into Darkness has just been released by Paramount. This wasn't in the trailer, and Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and someone named Cumberbatch are in it. UPDATE: Paramount has named the bad guy in the photo caption. Spoilers. Look at it down below. UPDATED: Cumberbrigged Check out the brand-new Star Trek Into Darkness image. Please note the new caption. (click to make it bigger) (From the left) STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is a movie made by Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions. Zachary Quinto plays Spock, Benedict Cumberbatch plays John Harrison, and Chris Pine plays Kirk. The new shot isn't from the "announcement" trailer that came out last week, and it won't be in the 9-minute preview that comes with Hobbit IMAX. However, it could be from the "teaser" trailer that comes out this weekend with the regular version of The Hobbit. Quick ideas: Cumberbatch is seen in the brig of the USS Enterprise (not seen in the 2009 Star Trek movie) Cumberbatch doesn't look too crazy or mad about it. There is glass between them (like what was seen in Japanese trailer) It's clear that Cumberbatch is wearing a Starfleet uniform. It looks like the ship is on red alert. So, who do you think is the bad guy?
