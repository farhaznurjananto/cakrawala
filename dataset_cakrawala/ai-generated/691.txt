Get ready for an exciting update on London's iconic Tube map! This March, tunnelling work is set to commence on the highly anticipated £1.2 billion Northern Line extension to Battersea Power Station, marking the first major addition to the map since the late 90s. Two massive 650-tonne tunnel boring machines – fittingly named Helen and Amy after pioneering British women, astronaut Helen Sharman, and aviator Amy Johnson – will embark on a thrilling six-month journey, carving out two-mile-long tunnels beneath the bustling city. Upon completion, passengers can look forward to a convenient new route starting at Kennington and ending at Battersea Power Station, featuring two stations at strategic locations – Nine Elms and the power station itself. Innovation meets history in this remarkable underground expansion!
