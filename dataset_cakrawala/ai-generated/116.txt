News on progress on the new station development

The new station development is progressing well, with the foundations and structural work now complete. The next stage of work will be the installation of the track and signalling infrastructure, followed by the construction of the station buildings and platforms.

We are working closely with the local authority, Network Rail and the train operating companies to deliver the new station as quickly as possible and it is expected to open in 2019. We would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their patience and cooperation during this time.

More information on the new station development can be found on our website or by visiting our station development page. Please contact us if you have any questions.

Thank you for your continued support.
