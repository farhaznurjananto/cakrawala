Electoral Access News Volume 32, No 3, August 1, 2016 OVER THE PAST 30 DAYS, FOUR BALLOT ACCESS WINNS Arizona: On July 19, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Eileen Willett issued a directive to the Secretary of State directing her to place the Green Party's presidential candidate on the November ballot. Reagan v. Arizona Green Party, case no. cv-16-2027. The Arizona Green Party has triumphed in a ballot access lawsuit three times prior to this one. The first occurred in 1999 when the party prevailed in a legal battle to overturn a rule stating that only independent voters could support an independent candidate (Campbell v Hull). A 2010 lawsuit against the prohibition on out-of-state circulators was the second (Arizona Green Party v Bennett). Because the Green Party missed the deadline of June 1 for certifying the names of its presidential elector candidates, the 2016 case was brought. Due to the late filing, according to the Secretary of State, the Green ticket will not appear on the November ballot. The defendant then filed a lawsuit, claiming that the deadline of June 1 is unconstitutional. The Secretary thought about it and decided not to make an argument for the deadline. The dispute was soon resolved because the state conceded. Georgia is the only other state that has a July 1 deadline for independent candidates to submit their names for consideration as presidential elector candidates. Arizona's deadline is unusually early because, prior to 1988, presidential elector candidates were chosen through the primary process. They are now selected through party meetings, which might take place much later in the year. In order to resolve the issue, the Libertarian Party launched a state court case in 1996 after missing the Arizona deadline. Although that case was successful, the legislature did not change the deadline. The Secretary of State has since announced that she will request a later deadline from the 2017 legislative session. In Arkansas, a statute requiring new parties (which nominate via convention) to choose all of their non-presidential nominees at least a year before the election was overturned on July 15 by U.S. District Court Judge James M. Moody, Jr. Martin v. the Libertarian Party of Arkansas, e.d., 4:15cv-635. The legislation was approved in 2015. According to the ruling, states cannot mandate that convention parties have their meetings before the day of the old parties' primary. The Democratic and Republican Parties' primaries were held in March of 2016; in 2018, they will be held in May. According to the ruling, the burden on the Libertarian Party is "slight," but the state has no reason to demand that the party's convention take place so soon. Regardless of the outcome of the case, the party had already held a convention in October 2015 and nominated 17 candidates who would appear on the November 2016 ballot. However, a second convention was conducted in February 2016 and four more candidates for the legislature and four more for county offices were proposed. These final eight candidates were not included on the ballot by the judge. Because the party did not sue the county election officials, the county candidates could not be elected. The judge determined that there was no justification for the four legislative candidates' exclusion from the list at the party's inaugural convention. Only four times has a court ruled that states cannot demand that convention parties select their nominees before the main parties do so. The other incidents occurred in Alabama in 1980 and in South Carolina in 1970 and 1972, respectively. These situations are uncommon since almost no state ever even mandates that convention parties conduct their conventions before primary parties. Maryland: On July 26, the State Board of Elections reached a settlement in the matter of Dorsey v. Lamone, which was brought against the number of signatures required to run as an independent statewide candidate last year. The Board's Settlement Agreement reads as follows: "Whereas the Parties concur that, contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments, unaffiliated candidates for statewide office in Maryland now face a disproportionate burden on their ability to get on the ballot when compared to candidates from new parties. Plaintiffs and Defendants concur that the Board will accept 10,000 signatures for the 2016 general election and any special general elections held in 2017." Greg Dorsey, an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate, had brought the complaint. In his case, he claimed that since new parties only needed 10,000 signatures, the state had no reason to ask him to gather 40,603 of them. Judge George Russell's decision from June 10 implied that the statute was questionable and rejected the state's bid to have the lawsuit dismissed. In accordance with the settlement, the Attorney General and the Board of Elections will ask the legislature to establish a law in 2017 that will reduce the required number of signatures for a statewide petition to 10,000. Pennsylvania: On June 30, Constitution Party of Pennsylvania v. Cortes, e.d., 5:12cv-2726 was decided by U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence Stengel. The order states that the statewide minor party's number of signatures and
