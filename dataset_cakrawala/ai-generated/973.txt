This FAQ is intended to aid new readers in comprehending the crime, its principals, cases, and our methodology. OVERVIEW: From May 10-17, 2010, three members of Dupont Circle will stand trial for the stabbing death of their longtime friend, Robert Wone. On August 2, 2006, around 12 a.m., Robert was discovered stabbed to death at his house at 1509 Swann Street, NW. Robert, a lawyer from Washington, D.C. who resided in Oakton, Virginia, arranged weeks in advance to spend the night at the residence of his college pal Joe Price. Price resided with his registered domestic partner Victor Zaborsky and their 'roommate' Dylan Ward at the time. The three gay housemates were present at the time of the murder and have since claimed that an unknown "intruder" broke into their home and murdered their straight roommate. Robert's murderer was unidentified for years due to an ostensibly defective investigation (conducted by DC Police, the FBI, and the US Secret Service) and, at times, a lackadaisical prosecution. In October of 2008, the initial charges were brought. Before calling 911, the prosecution stated that Robert was injected with a paralytic substance, sexually abused, restrained, stabbed, bathed, redressed, and placed in bed. The housemates will be tried in DC Superior Court on May 10, although they are not being charged with murder. They are instead charged with interfering with a crime scene, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice (lying to and misdirecting investigators). The prosecution believes that the defendants know who committed the murder and are covering for them. ESSENTIAL READING: Begin with the Robert Wone Wiki page for a summary of the principles and fees.

The four of us have been friends, partners, and exes for nearly two decades; we are each other's chosen family. Over a dinner in early December, we recognized that we both had an intense interest in this case and a strong desire to learn the truth about the murder of an extraordinary young guy. We also shared the frustration that the investigation into his murder has dragged on for years due to a glacially slow legal process and scant investigative media coverage. As four men who make a livelihood in the media, we were also attracted to this story due to its classic Washington scandal ingredients: power, sex, suspected drug usage, and mystery. But why is there so little actual buzz on the streets? It appeared to be an enormous gap. We developed whomurderedrobertwone.com to reinvigorate the discussion, inspire more debate, serve as a clearinghouse, and increase the amount of people who can contribute insightful analysis and want to see justice served. We compile media coverage and offer original commentary, investigation, and analysis of the case. Our editorial structure necessitates a holistic examination of all relevant factors and principles. We solicit guest comments and encourage an open dialogue and the exchange of responsible ideas and viewpoints. Several issues are of an adult and violent nature. These difficulties cannot be presented in a purely clinical manner, and the language required to address the components of this case and crime frequently necessitates a great deal of leeway to meet the perspectives of various and diverse audiences. Why are there no aliases? We openly utilize our identities, Craig Brownstein, David Greeley, Michael Kremin, and Doug Johnson, since we wish to work as honestly as possible. Everyone of us brings unique insights and experiences to our endeavor. We support neither prosecution nor defense. We want to hold every bit of evidence under the light, stress test every reasonable theory and learn the fullest picture possible of Mr. Wone's murder. 3: Did you know
