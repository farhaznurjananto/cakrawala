Charlie Barsotti, one of the great cartoonists of our time, passed away a week ago. When I was in high school, his work was in the New Yorker almost every week. I used to love to see that little man with his big hat walking the streets. I’ve always admired Barsotti’s work. He was a true master of the art of cartooning.

Here’s a nice tribute to Barsotti from the New Yorker:
