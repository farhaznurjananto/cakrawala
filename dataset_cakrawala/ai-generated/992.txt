Recently, the Guardian took the decision to cut down the number of places where we open comments on stories relating to a few contentious subjects â€“ particularly migration and race. The aim isn't to stop comments appearing at all, but rather to enable us to manage them more effectively, keep a closer watch on the conversation, feed back what's being said, and make sure the discussion is constructive and not abusive. We hope it'll help us to be responsible hosts, essentially. 
  We expect a great deal of our commenters, and we try to hold them to some specific standards. We want to host conversations where there is a constructive debate, where our audience can help us broaden our journalism with their expertise, their knowledge, their considered thoughts and opinions, and where they can use our site as a platform to make connections with the world and with those around them. It's not hard to see the value there. 
  One thing that prevents constructive conversations in the long run is the structure of sites like The Guardian. Comments here are primarily about the story, not the narrator. Unlike many social platforms, there is no flow and no personalized browsing that shows you the people you want to connect with. Each new  thread of comments is a new environment, a new forum for collective discussion, developing its own identity and culture, often shaped for better or worse by the first few comments. expectations even within  broader rules
