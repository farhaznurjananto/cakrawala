Well that quite a week. Huge thanks to everyone for the kind words, comments and support. It's been overwhelming at times especially when I was in the hospital for surgery. I'm so grateful for all the amazing people I've met through this blog. Thank you so much for your support. 
Sorry for the delayed post. Here are my paper creations from this week. I had a lot of fun with the last sketch from 2Sketches4You. I used the sketch to create a thank you card for my friend who has been so supportive during my surgery. I used some cute paper from Basic Grey.
