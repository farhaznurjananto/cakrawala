Native American tribes, clans, and leaders spanning seven US states and Canada are asserting that the recent decision by the US government to lift protections for grizzly bears within Yellowstone National Park infringes upon their religious freedom. In response, they have initiated legal action against the government, aiming to prevent grizzly bear hunts from taking place in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. These tribes contend that their religious and spiritual beliefs were disregarded due to inadequate consultation by government officials prior to the decision. As grizzly bears hold a sacred position in their belief systems, the tribes maintain that their spiritual connections should have been considered. Ben Nuvamsa, a former chairman of Arizona's Hopi tribe, for example, regards the grizzly bear as both a deity and a clan uncle. The US Justice Department has yet to respond to these claims.
