Milton Keynes Dons' gifted midfielder, Dele Alli, has been recognized for his exceptional start to the season by being awarded the Football League Young Player of the Month for August. The 19-year-old, connected with possible moves to Liverpool and Bayern Munich, scored two goals during the month, against Peterborough and Crawley, and has since maintained his excellent form with another goal at the beginning of September.

In a conversation with The Football League, Alli expressed his gratitude for the award: "I'm delighted, it's a significant achievement, but I couldn't do it without the team. It's a credit to be able to win this award in such a young team." He also highlighted the importance of his manager's support, "Without the manager giving me the opportunity and supporting me - I can't say thank you enough to him or the players."

Alli's progress at MK Dons was acknowledged on Thursday when he was awarded a contract extension until 2017. However, with numerous admirers within higher-ranked leagues, it appears unlikely that Stadium MK will remain his home for the entire duration of the contract. One such admirer is manager Brendan Rodgers, and Alli is well aware of the interest.

Regarding the attention, Alli said, "'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away. I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about."

Last month, Alli's talent was showcased to a broader audience during his performance against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup, which captured considerable attention. Alli was part of the MK Dons team that defeated Manchester United 4-0, and he confesses that he relished the experience of testing himself against top-level opposition.

Reflecting on the match, Alli said, "That game against United gave me great inspiration because that's where I want to be playing - in the top leagues against the top teams. It showed I am capable of doing that eventually."

Even as larger clubs show interest, Alli remains content in his hometown of Milton Keynes and plans to continue delivering impressive performances until the time comes for him to advance in his career.
