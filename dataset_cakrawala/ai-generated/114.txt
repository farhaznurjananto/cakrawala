Fresh from reclaiming its crown as the nation’s favourite holiday park, Haven has invested £3million in its Heacham Manor resort.

The park, which includes a golf course, has seen the introduction of two new indoor show bars, the opening of its very first indoor water play zone and a new kids’ entertainment venue.

The work was completed last month, ready for the season to begin.

And this was just the start.

Plans are in place for further investment across the resort, including adding a new outdoor pool and refurbishing Heacham Manor’s holiday homes.

As well as the investment in the resort, Haven has also added a new fleet of luxury caravans, including the stunning Prestige range, so that its guests can enjoy the very best of holidaying.

The Prestige range of caravans come with a choice of three or four bedrooms, a spacious lounge, a fully equipped kitchen and a divine master bedroom with its own en-suite.

The three-bedroom Prestige caravans can accommodate up to eight people, while the four-bedroom version sleeps up to 10 people.

Haven’s Heacham Manor is open from Easter to October, and is the perfect place to enjoy a relaxing break.
