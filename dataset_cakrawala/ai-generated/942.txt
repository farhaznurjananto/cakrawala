Selection and storage Jicamas can be available year around in the markets. Generally, they imported from central American countries through land route and flood the USA markets during spring and summer. Choose well-formed, firm, round, medium sized tubers. Avoid soft, shriveled, or tubers with surface cuts, cracks, and bruise skin. Once at home, jicamas can be stored much like potatoes. They have good shelf life and keep well in a cool, dry, dark place for about 2-4 weeks. Exposure to a temperature below 10 C results in chill-induced changes in color and texture. Also, prolong storage converts its starch into sugar, which makes the roots less sought after in savory dishes. Cut sections, cubes or slices, however, should be placed inside the refrigerator. Preparation and serving methods Wash in cool running water and dry mop just like in other tubers. Peel off the thick fibrous skin using a vegetable peeler or paring knife. Peel and other plant parts contain rotenone, an organic poison; and therefore, should be discarded. It then can be cut into cubes, sliced, or chopped into fine strips in a ways desired. Fresh jicama is used much like a vegetable and is an important starch source in much of Central America. It stays crisp when cooked, making it one of the wonderful vegetable in stir-fries.
