Let me just start by saying that I think the whole concept of the modern day superhero is one of the most fascinating things in the world. I love the superhero genre, and I think it is the perfect combination of the best things in the world: the best action, the best fantasy, the best drama, and the best science fiction. It is all of these things combined into one, and it is absolutely fascinating.

However, with that said, I also think that the superhero genre has been done to death. There are so many superhero movies these days, and so many superhero TV shows, that it is hard to keep track of them all. And, quite frankly, I am getting a little bit tired of them.

But, that does not mean that I do not still love the superhero genre. I do. I just think that it needs to be done in a different way. And, that is what I think the new Netflix show, The Defenders, is doing.

The Defenders is a new Netflix show that is set in the Marvel Universe. However, it is not about the Avengers, or the X-Men, or any of the other big name superhero teams. It is about a team of heroes that are not as well known.

The team is made up of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist. And, I think that this is a great idea. The Marvel Universe is huge, and there are a lot of different heroes out there. And, by focusing on a team of heroes that are not as well known, The Defenders is able to explore the different sides of the superhero genre in a way that is more interesting.

For example, Daredevil is the showâ€™s main protagonist. He is a wealthy lawyer who is also a vigilante. He uses his skills as a lawyer to fight crime, and he also uses his martial arts skills to fight criminals. But, he is not just a one-dimensional character. He is also a deeply emotional character, and he is able to explore these emotions in a way that is interesting and unique.

Jessica Jones is also a fascinating character. She is a private detective who is also a superhero. She uses her skills as a detective to fight crime, and she also uses her super strength and her ability to fly to fight the bad guys. But, she is not just a one-dimensional character. She is also a deeply emotional character, and she is able to explore these emotions in a way that is interesting and
