Sears Holding Co. has revealed that the point-of-sale registers at Kmart stores had been compromised by malicious software that extracted customer credit and debit card information. The company has taken steps to deactivate the malware and contain the breach, but the investigation is ongoing. The breach began in early September, as further analyses by IT security experts showed that the Kmart payment data systems had been infiltrated with malware that could not be detectable by anti-malware systems. 

Chris Brathwaite, spokesman for Sears, disclosed that they have detected that the data stolen included only "track 2" information from customer credit and debit cards. This information does not include customer personal details such as name, email address, physical address, social security numbers, PINs, nor any other sensitive information. However, he stressed that the track 2 data could allow cybercriminals to produce fake versions of the stolen credit cards. Brathwaite reassured customers that, to date, there has been no fraudulent use of the compromised cards.

While the incident impact from the breach is yet to be determined, Sears has no indication that any Sears, Roebuck customers were affected by the breach. At present, the malware only infected the payment data systems at Kmart stores, and the impact was limited to customers who had used debit or credit card payments at Kmart within the affected period. 

Currently, Sears and Kmart are working closely with IT security firms, the payment processor and card brands to find any leads and enable them to uncover the extent of the data breach. At the same time, they are fully cooperating with authorities from state and federal agencies in their investigations. Along with the ongoing investigation, the company also urges customers who've used their cards at Kmart from early September onward, to check their account statements regularly, watch for any unauthorised transactions, and report any suspicious activities immediately.

Given the data breach, Sears Holding Co. reiterates their commitment to keep customersâ€™ data safe, and is investing heavily in updating their cyber security systems. Meanwhile, the company apologises for this undue inconvenience caused to their customers, reassuring them that everything is being done to resolve the situation quickly and efficiently.
