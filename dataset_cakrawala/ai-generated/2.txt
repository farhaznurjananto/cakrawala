Less than a tenth of companies that have been served with a notice to attend a tax enquiry have challenged the decision, the latest figures reveal.

The figures, published by HMRC, show that between April and June 2018, only 6% of businesses who received a section 20A notice from HMRC challenged the decision.

A section 20A notice, also known as a notice of enquiry, is a formal notice that informs a business that HMRC will be investigating a specific part of their tax affairs.

Under the graduated response, companies that are found to be avoiding tax could face a fine, a criminal prosecution, or both.

In April, HMRC announced that it
