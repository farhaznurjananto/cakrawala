The following content needs to be rewritten and organized in a coherent, understandable and professional article:

Recently, I picked up Grandaddy without knowing where the Zombie Monkey came from. Although the reviews I read prepared me for a more electronic sound, the album gave me an indie-pop vibe with keyboards and drum machines. The singer writes songs about robots, which is an awesome feature. The transition between "Saddest Vacant Lot in All the World" to "Stray Dog and the Chocolate Shake" is an interesting shift from a heartbreaking ballad to a silly pop song with a cheesy yet catchy keyboard hook, reminiscent of The Microphones. If this indie-pop genre is your thing, this album is definitely worth listening to.

The QC forums have been a great source of fantastic discussions lately, particularly, the music board where tons of new people are bringing in lots of interesting posts. I have the coolest readers of ANYONE and will fight anyone who disagrees. In fact, I plan to cross-breed all of my forum-goers to produce a super-race of hyper-intelligent music aficionados.

My girlfriend Heather is selling lovely handmade hats, scarfs, and even sexy arm warmers for a reasonable price. They are super-warm and comfortable, and you can find them here.

QC is also crushing the other webcomics over on Buzzcomix, thanks to our cool readers who keep voting us up. Keep it up!

The first batch of "Tip" T-shirts should be ready for shipping within two weeks for everyone who pre-ordered. Once I get another 10 orders, I will start the second batch of printing and shipping them out to people who ordered them in the past two weeks.

Finally, I have added a PayPal button below these newsposts to allow my readers the option to donate if they feel like contributing to supporting the site. It's not mandatory, though, as I'm not about to get frostbite or die of scurvy.

I hope you enjoy today's comic and have a great day. See you on Monday!
