A group of the world's leading climate scientists have expressed increasing concern about the possibility of runaway climate change, warning that an extinction event may be looming. The primary cause of this potential crisis is methane. The Arctic Methane Emergency Group (AMEG) has studied key non-linear trends in the Earth's climate and concluded that the planet may be on the verge of abrupt and catastrophic climate change due to an unprecedented rate of change in the Arctic.

Methane is over twenty times more potent than carbon dioxide at absorbing infrared radiation emitted from the earth's surface and preventing it from escaping into space. Methane levels in the atmosphere have reached 1,874 parts per billion (ppb), more than double the highest levels measured since 400,000 years before the industrial revolution.

In 2012, researchers discovered methane bubbling up from deep ocean sites in the Arctic. Methane emissions are also locked under Antarctic ice, with calculations suggesting that the potential amount of methane hydrate and free methane gas under the Antarctic Ice Sheet could be up to four billion metric tons.

The Arctic Methane Emergency Group (AMEG) reports that the Arctic is currently experiencing an extreme meltdown, leading the group to declare a high international security risk of acute climate disruption followed by runaway global warming. Furthermore, Russian scientists have discovered methane plumes in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf that extend over one kilometer in diameter.

This increasing release of methane into the atmosphere can be attributed to a cycle which began 20-30 years ago, when Atlantic and Pacific Ocean currents, warmed by greenhouse gases, flowed into the Arctic Ocean. This extra heat leads to declines in sea ice and increased regional temperatures. Consequently, methane trapped for millions of years is released into the atmosphere, with the potential to lead to a chain reaction of runaway overheating of the planet.

Historically, methane was involved in a mass extinction event approximately two hundred million years ago, referred to as "The Great Dying," where over half of all life forms became extinct. The Arctic Methane Emergency Group calls for urgent recognition and action to address this crisis, as the impact on food prices and global climate policy may be devastating.
