The Phoenix Suns' starting point guard, Eric Bledsoe, is reportedly up for trade, with several teams showing interest in acquiring him. Michael Scotto, the writer for Basketball Insiders, states that the Denver Nuggets are among those who expressed interest in Bledsoe, with Emmanuel Mudiay and Kenneth Faried as potential assets going to the Suns. The New York Knicks, Milwaukee Bucks, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Clippers are also reportedly in the running for acquiring the talented player. Bledsoe is likely to move to a new team soon, after tweeting about his discontent with Phoenix. Chris Haynes of ESPN reported that the Suns sent Bledsoe home on Monday, adding that the veteran will no longer be part of the team moving forward. Despite being plagued with injuries throughout his NBA career, Bledsoe managed to average 18.8 points and 6.0 assists per game since joining the Suns in 2013 as a regular starter. He was also ranked as the 10th-best point guard in the NBA for the 2017-2018 season by Dan Favale of Bleacher Report. The Suns' messy separation with Bledsoe might also be a disadvantage for the team in terms of negotiation. In contrast, when Kyrie Irving put in his trade request for the Cleveland Cavaliers, owner Dan Gilbert's stance remained unchanged regarding Irving's position in the team. Despite the Cavaliers' knowledge of Irving's request, the team managed to receive an excellent trade haul with Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic, and the Brooklyn Nets' first-round pick. Conversely, the Suns might not be as lucky when trading Bledsoe, given that General Manager Ryan McDonough had already publicly announced that the team is moving on from the player.
