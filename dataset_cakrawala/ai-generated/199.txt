France Football reports that Didier Drogba is set to make a shock return to the Premier League. The Ivorian star has been linked with a move to QPR, but the latest reports suggest that Chelsea also want to bring him back to the club.

The report says that Jose Mourinho is keen to add the experienced striker to his squad, but not at the cost of signing a big name player.

Drogba has been linked with a move to Chelsea in the past, but the Blues were not willing to meet his wage demands.

The 36-year-old striker is currently playing for Galatasaray, but his contract expires at the end of the season.

Drogba has scored 16 goals in 31 appearances for Galatasaray this season.

Do you think Drogba will join Chelsea?
