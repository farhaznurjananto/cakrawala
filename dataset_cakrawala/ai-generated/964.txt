Now that the "alt-right," as personified by Stephen Bannon, is in the White House, conservative leaders are attempting to determine where it fits within the larger movement. MARYLAND'S NATIONAL HARBOR Donald Trump put an end to the movement conservatism. What other way to explain the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference? During the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race, many self-described conservatives declared that Trump was not one of their number. The American Conservative Union (ACU), which sponsors the annual CPAC conference, celebrated the Trump administration from the main stage on Thursday, featuring the administration's top figures in various formats, including a rare public interview with chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, the "economic nationalist" who prides himself on providing "the platform for the 'alt-right'" during his tenure as CEO of Breitbart News. The term "alt-right" refers to a group of hate groups and their leaders who openly declare white supremacy, misogyny, homophobia, Islamophobia, and/or anti-Semitism as part of their ideology. Since Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential bid, movement conservatism has attempted to express those same prejudices through the language of such grand philosophical principles as individual liberty, the beauty of small government, and the moral hazard of allowing government to keep poor people from going hungry. Trump and his advisers were astute in recognizing that the same fuel of rage and resentment that animated conservatism no longer required those ideological trappings and could be channeled in the service of the businessman's ideologically squishy presidential campaign. Trump and his advisers were astute in recognizing that the same fuel of rage and resentment that animated conservatism no longer required those ideological trappings and could be channeled in the service of the businessman's ideologically squishy presidential campaign. Throughout the campaign, Trump retweeted posts from white supremacist accounts, amplifying smears against African-Americans and others and engaging voters outside the "alt-right" pool by normalizing the movement's rhetoric. Conservatives are eager to claim Trump's victory as their own, if this year's CPAC is any indication. (On the first day of the conference, Bannon appeared alongside Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.) But now that the "alt-right," as personified by Bannon, is in the White House, conservative leaders are on pins and needles, trying to figure out where the "alt-right" fits into the larger movement. Just hours before ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp met with Bannon and Priebus, ACU Executive Director Dan Schneider declared that the term "alt-right" had been "hijacked" by a "left-wing fascist group." "They stole the term specifically to confuse us," he added. Schneider was referring to the white nationalist National Policy Institute (NPI), which is led by Richard B. Spencer. "They met just a few months ago in Washington, DC, to spew their hatred and give their 'Heil Hitler' salutes," Schneider explained. (He failed to mention that attendees at the NPI's Nov. 19 conference raised their arms in support of Trump, hardly a left-winger.) An hour later, Spencer arrived at CPAC, where a show was made of escorting him off the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, where the conference is being held, but only after he was allowed to hold court with journalists for more than 30 minutes, according to Bloomberg News' Jennifer Jacobs. The truth is that, with Bannon's appointment as White House strategist, the "alt-right" is where the energy is today in right-wing circles. But even before CPAC's opening session, the American Conservative Union had an "alt-right" problem, one of its own making, when it abruptly announced the addition of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos as a conference keynoter, then just as abruptly rescinded the invitation when a video went viral showing Yiannopoulos endorsing the sexual abuse of pubescent boys by Roman Catholic priests. The fact that Yiannopoulos is notorious for outrageous expressions of racism and misogyny was apparently of little concern to CPAC leaders prior to the video. They wanted to bring up the cool kid onstage. The truth is that, with Bannon's appointment as White House strategist, the "alt-right" is where the energy is today in right-wing circles. If not Bannon's creation, Yiannopoulos was one of his stars at Breitbart News, the senior editor whom Peter Montgomery of Right Wing Watch described as the right's gay enfant terrible. Yiannopoulos was in charge of writing.
