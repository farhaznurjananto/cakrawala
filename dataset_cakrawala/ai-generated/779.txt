VR headset developer kits from Acer and HP, powered by Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 Mixed Reality platform, are available for pre-order now starting at around $300. 
 According to Microsoft, the hardware in the headsets themselves probably won't change  when these systems start shipping to developers and when they go on sale to consumers in a push planned for the holidays this year. Of course, you will lose your software and content  until then. The Windows OS itself continues to evolve to fully support mixed reality at the core of the system. This means that to actually do anything with the headset before the consumer pushes it, you have to be a developer, use his Windows in  development mode, and code the software  for the kit yourself. 
 Both HP and Acer headsets feature LCD displays and are expected to be more affordable than the OLED displays used in Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. These pricier screens offer a smoother, more  comfortable experience for most users, but some of those benefits may be missing on Acer and HP systems.This week's Microsoft Build conference When I tried the Acer Development Edition headset in the demo, I noticed some visual stuttering when moving my head back and forth and moving my whole body left and right. The reason for stuttering is unknown. Another of his Upload creators tried out the headset  at a recent event in New York and described it as "motion blurring and fuzzing when he's moving."
