The euro zone’s debt crisis is now entering a new and dangerous phase. Amid a widening rift between the bloc’s core and periphery, Greece’s woes are prompting a withdrawal of capital from other vulnerable economies and raising the risk of a wider European banking crisis.

Greece’s fiscal problems are not isolated. Ireland and Portugal have already accepted bailouts, and Italy, Spain and Belgium are in danger of following suit. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged that the euro zone is “in the biggest test of its existence.”

Markets are now expecting a Greek default. The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds jumped to a new euro-era high of 21.1 percent on Tuesday, and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default has risen to a record. The euro’s recent decline against the dollar has added to the pressure on European equities and has put further downward pressure on the euro’s value against other currencies.

Investors are increasingly concerned that Europe’s debt crisis will spread beyond Greece. Last week, stock markets around the world tumbled on concerns that a Greek default would lead to a domino effect, triggering a banking crisis in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Belgium.

The recent wave of market turmoil has highlighted the fragility of the euro zone’s banking system. Euro zone banks are estimated to have exposure of €1.1 trillion to the debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Italy, a sum that is more than three times the bloc’s total banking assets.

If a banking crisis were to erupt in any of these countries, it would have a devastating impact on the euro zone’s economy.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is trying to avert a banking crisis by providing liquidity to the euro zone’s banks. But this measure is not a panacea. If banks are unable to access ECB funds, they will become insolvent, and the ECB’s ability to prevent a banking crisis will be compromised.

The ECB’s decision to provide liquidity to the euro zone’s banks has also led to a sharp increase in the price of government bonds. This is because the ECB is buying government bonds from the markets, thereby pushing down the interest rates on these bonds and increasing the value of these assets in the market.

This policy has had the
