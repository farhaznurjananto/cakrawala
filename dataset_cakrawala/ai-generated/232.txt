Maine Governor, Paul LePage, has intensified his warning that supporters of a state ballot question to increase the minimum wage should be jailed, describing them as guilty of “attempted murder” against senior citizens because of the alleged impact of a wage increase. Democrat-affiliated advocates, Mike Tipping and Ben Chin, both employed by the Maine People’s Alliance, have been targeted by LePage, who claims they are aware that the policy will hurt Maine citizens. Tipping and Chin have rejected LePage’s allegations, stating that the policy brief, recently published by the National Employment Law Project, shows that a minimum wage hike would benefit many seniors.
 
Approximately 36,000 Mainers who are over the age of 65 are still working, with one third of that group earning low wages. If the referendum passes, their salaries will be increased. A study by the University of California Berkeley reveals that prices in Maine will increase by only 0.9% over a four-year period.  LePage has refused to release a $50m bond which was voted overwhelmingly in favour by constituents of the state. The money would have been used to build affordable housing for seniors who are currently struggling due to the state’s shortage of affordable homes. More than 168 candidates running for election or re-election to the Maine Legislature have pledged to pass legislation that will force LePage to release the bonds.
 
LePage has responded to criticism by stating that the constitution will need to change, “because we are not going to be able to function.” His comments have been criticised by political scientist, Lilliana Mason, who commented: “We thought those norms were relatively strong. At times this year, it’s been clear they’re fragile. We’ve become more polarised and there’s a preference for political victory over the greater good of the nation…”
