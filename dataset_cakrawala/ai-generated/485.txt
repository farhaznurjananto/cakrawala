When Meb Keflezighi triumphed at the Boston Marathon, he crossed the finish line wearing Skechers, a brand better known for toning the glutes of football legend Joe Montana. This surprising choice of footwear was the result of a split with Nike, Meb's former sponsor.

In an industry dominated by names like Nike and Adidas, sponsorship is essential for athletes, providing not only top-quality equipment but also a steady salary and bonus structure based on performance. However, things can turn sour if an athlete experiences injuries or a dip in performance, as reduction clauses in contracts can significantly decrease their earnings.

Some athletes, like Meb, have found success with lesser-known brands such as Skechers and Under Armour, who are willing to invest in athletes that the more prominent companies have disregarded. With more resources to spare, these smaller brands are giving their athletes the support they need to excel.

Nick Arciniaga, for instance, signed with Under Armour just before the Boston Marathon and performed exceptionally, finishing seventh overall – the second American athlete over the line – with the second-fastest marathon time of his career. Had Adidas, his former sponsor, found the funds to support him, they may have been part of his success.

Similarly, American runner Leo Manzano had difficulty finding a sustainable deal with Nike, opting to sign with the small running shoe company Hoka One One. Despite Hoka not producing competitive footwear, Manzano still claimed victory at the 2014 USA 1 Mile Road Championships.

Meb Keflezighi's success while wearing Skechers shoes highlights the missed opportunities for companies like Nike, while giving smaller brands the exposure they need to make waves in the world of professional running.
