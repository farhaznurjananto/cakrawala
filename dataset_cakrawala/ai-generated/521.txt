Title: The Blooded Slayer: A Cursed Warrior Battling for Redemption
Author: Daniel Trentacoste

The Blooded Slayer is a tormented soul who once fell victim to a cursed magic. Daily, they strive to regain their true selves, despite bearing the burden of corruption within their tainted vessels. Found within a realm of mysticism and chaos, these characters possess immense power, granted to them by dark magic. With this power, they yearn to recover their lost humanity, even as they battle the sinister forces that threaten the world.

Embodiment of the Blooded Slayer

A scarred warrior enters the battleground, slicing through his chest with an ancient blade to manifest a rusted, blood-stained weapon. Grinning through the pain, this formidable figure charges into the fray, shrouded in a mist of blood. After the haze clears, the warrior stands alone and victorious, drenched in the viscera of his enemies.

In another scene, a group of bandits eagerly anticipates their next victim, a humanoid figure draped in a cloak. Confident in their prospects of plundering this seemingly easy target, they are shocked when the cloaked figure summons a pool of blood, steps into it, and disappears. The same individual, now unmasked as a gaunt half-elf, emerges and effortlessly dispatches the startled bandits, leaving a gruesome trail in their wake.

The Sanguine Pact: Origin of the Blooded Slayer

This fearsome warrior, known as the Blooded Slayer, is created by exposure to the dreadful ritual of the Sanguine Pact. This sinister process robs the subject of their humanity, stripping away their soul and replacing it with an innate understanding of the inner workings of living bodies. Blood holds a special attraction for the Blooded Slayer, who uses their ability to harness the vital fluid for their unique powers.

The Struggle for Redemption

Survivors of the Sanguine Pact are tormented by the loss of their humanity, seeking ways to recover it. Some attempt to return to a normal life, while others struggle with haunting memories of their past selves. Most are destined to become misunderstood drifters, outcasts in a hostile world. The fortunate few find solace and support within a party of adventurers who embrace them despite their flaws.

Despite the loss of their humanity, the Blooded Slayer's instincts are heightened to an almost bestial level. Their perception is keen, enabling them to anticipate events with remarkable accuracy. However, interacting in civilized society often proves challenging for these warriors, who are usually seen as outcasts or madmen due to their disheveled appearance and erratic behavior.

The Life of a Blooded Slayer

Together with their gore-drenched weaponry, Blooded Slayers don medium or light armor for maximum speed and agility. Their fearsome red eyes and otherworldly pallor betray their cursed origins, marked indelibly by the Sanguine Pact. Although they may appear frail, underestimating these formidable warriors would be a grave mistake.

Creating a Blooded Slayer

When creating a Blooded Slayer character, consider their background before the curse of the Sanguine Pact took hold. Were they a trained warrior or did they acquire their skills through the ritual? What led them to participate in such a dark pact, and how might they seek redemption as a Blooded Slayer? These characters often excel in combat and instinctual understanding, but typically struggle in communication and diplomacy. Finding a party with complementary skills and strengths is vital to their success and survival.

The Path of the Blooded Slayer

As a Blooded Slayer, players gain a variety of skills and abilities, including heightened perception and primal instincts. The Sanguine Pact has imbued them with uncanny talents, such as sensing the presence of blood and detecting living creatures within a certain range. However, their curse also limits their capacity to master charisma-based skills and saving throws.

Blooded Slayers can adopt a specialized fighting style, such as Archery, Defense, Dueling or Great Weapon Fighting, to enhance their combat prowess. As they progress, the gains in proficiency bonuses, ability score improvements, and new features combine to make them increasingly formidable adversaries.

In conclusion, the Blooded Slayer offers players a complex and intriguing character archetype, grappling with both the supernatural powers granted by the Sanguine Pact and the tragic loss of their humanity. As they journey ever closer to redemption, these cursed warriors learn to harness their abilities and connections to regain a semblance of their former selves.
