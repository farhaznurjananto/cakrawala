The MAD Documentary team is excited to announce that they have reached their fundraising goal through the generous contributions of supporters. The team extends their profound thanks to everyone who has made a donation to the campaign. 

We all can agree that the MAD Magazine has been an important part of our culture since its inception, and this documentary is meant to pay tribute to the iconic publication. While reaching the original goal was a significant step towards seeing the project through the production phase, much needs to be done before we can see this documentary on our screens.

The team behind the MAD Documentary is committed to going above and beyond to make this project much more than we could ever imagine. Your contribution is still paramount to help turn this ambitious vision into reality. The team remains open to receiving more donations from those who still want to be part of this novel project. 

In continuation of the project's progress, Tom Richmond, a MAD artist and an all-around nice guy, has generously volunteered to provide the artwork for the project poster. For a donation of $50 or more, donors will receive a mini-poster signed by the renowned artist himself.

But Tom Richmond has gone a step further. He is offering fans of MAD Magazine an incredibly special offer to own a piece of original, hand-drawn artwork from a MAD Magazine Artist. For a donation of $2,500, Tom Richmond will donate the actual artwork for the poster, inked and hand-colored. It is an amazing deal that you do not want to miss. 

This offer is a one-time shot opportunity to own a distinctive item of art from a distinguished artist who has made a significant contribution to MAD Magazine.

Please visit Tom's website for further details on this extraordinary offer.

The team behind the MAD documentary encourages you to continue supporting the project, as it is a unique testament to the beloved MAD Magazine, an institution in American humor and satire. It will also be a reference for future generations to understand the significance of MAD Magazine in shaping our cultural landscape.

In conclusion, the MAD Documentary Team would like to thank everyone who has supported the project thus far and invites everyone who is eager to see this project come to fruition to consider making a donation today. By doing so, you would be contributing to documenting this significant part of our American history. Remember, the frosting is always much sweeter with a little more support!
