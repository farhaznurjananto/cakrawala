FORGOTTEN DARE #6: INDUCE SLEEP PARALYSIS

Sleep paralysis is a normal part of sleep. It occurs when your body transitions between sleep states. Although itâ€™s not dangerous, it can be frightening and uncomfortable.

There are two types of sleep paralysis. The first is called hypnagogic or predormital sleep paralysis. It occurs when youâ€™re falling asleep. The second is called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep paralysis. It happens when youâ€™re waking up.

Sleep paralysis can be caused by sleep deprivation, stress, jet lag, and certain medications. Itâ€™s also more common in people with narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other sleep disorders.

There are a few things you can do to reduce your risk of sleep paralysis, such as getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding alcohol and drugs. If you experience sleep paralysis, there are a few things you can do to ease your symptoms, such as moving your eyes side to side or taking deep breaths.

Just be sure to prepare yourself beforehand and be aware of your surroundings. And if you experience any discomfort, donâ€™t hesitate to seek help. Sleep paralysis can be a fun and creepy experience, but itâ€™s also worth being aware of your surroundings. Remember: sleep paralysis is just a part of sleep. And itâ€™s nothing to be afraid of. ðŸ™‚
