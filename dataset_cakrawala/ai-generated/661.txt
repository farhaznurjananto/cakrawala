The Pentagon, through the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), is actively seeking innovative proposals to develop an airborne platform capable of deploying and recovering drones. By focusing on the utilization of existing aircraft, such as B-1, B-52, or C-130 models, DARPA aims to create a launch and recovery system for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).

This ingenuous concept would potentially extend the range of these drones and enable them to embark on new missions that are currently unattainable due to their limited flying distance. In essence, the project seeks to transform the current aircraft inventory of the Pentagon into strategic platforms that could transport UAS closer to target areas. Once deployed, the drones can effectively perform their designated tasks, such as bombing, missile strikes, or reconnaissance, before returning safely to the "mothership" aircraft.
