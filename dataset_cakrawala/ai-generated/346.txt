Liverpool's teenage defender Joe Gomez made his Anfield debut on Monday night to wide applause. Not only does his performance merit attention from those who supported and nurtured his skills to the Premier League, but the Football Association sees in him a symbol of the perfect marriage of patience and opportunity. Joe has proven that excellent talent will thrive when there is enough patience accompanied by opportunities. 

At 18 years of age, Gomez could have opted for the lavish promises of a Premier League academy that appealed when he was 13 years old. Two of his outstanding age group at youth level signed with Chelsea, which left Charlton Athletic naturally disappointed. However, Gomez and his family decided on the developmental road plan that Charlton’s academy manager Steve Avory and former director Paul Hart provided him. Charlton sees it as an achievement when someone follows the same path that Joe did. They encourage parents to bring their children to the academy as they can see a pathway to the first team rather than the temptation of wealthier clubs.

For Avory, who has worked with Gomez since he joined Charlton’s Lewisham development center as a nine-year-old, there is no shock at his response when Liverpool approached him. he was surprised at the speed of his promotion but praised his mental strength, which has held him in good stead at Liverpool. He is level-headed, conscientious and composed. Avory vouches for Joe’s grounded nature and diligence.

Charlton’s former academy director, Paul Hart says Joe reminded him of Jonathan Woodgate when he worked with him at Leeds. Hart believes Joe will be a center-half eventually but noted his versatility already. Besides, he says, Joe is probably stronger physically, he has all the attributes to be a top player. Hart adds that there are very few players out there who make you sit up and take notice, and Joe certainly is one of them. He further elaborates that sometimes other managers do not take the same approach as Brendan Rodgers. In the future, the English team may be made largely of championship players if that continues to happen.  

Sean O’Driscoll, the former England U-19 coach, assisted in Joe's immediate promotion, which was assisted by Rodgers’s. O’Driscoll affirms that during the 19's game against Germany in Düsseldorf in which his composure struck him as exceptional, the call requests for Joe came from many other Premier League managers.  

Bournemouth wanted him, but Joe opted for Liverpool. When they see Joe making headway at Anfield, former Charlton scholars Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett, who signed with Chelsea, may well ask which pathway to the Premier League presents the fastest track.
