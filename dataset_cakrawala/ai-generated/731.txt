In September 2011, I asked if anyone had tried Phil Maffetone's Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training (PDF). It seemed like an incredibly simplistic approach, and I was a little skeptical about the effectiveness of such a "slow" walking approach, so I threw the question on the table. 
 After much research and  good feedback from others, on his January 23rd of this year, I sincerely immersed myself in his MAF training world. Still very concerned about training at an incredibly slow pace, I didn't take the plunge right away.By John Hadd Walsh, known as "Hadd's Approach to Distance Training" (PDF) huge article. In October 2011 he recorded 135 miles and in November 2011 he recorded 155 miles. That said, it was fine, but deep down inside I was like, "What  if I train with the idea of ​​MAF?"
