This summer, the Department of Homeland Security will commence the construction of prototypes for a border wall in the San Diego area. This important development signifies the first step in fulfilling President Trump's campaign promise to strengthen the southern border of the United States.

Homeland security officials stated that these prototypes will be integrated with the existing border walls in San Diego, allowing the agency to thoroughly examine and evaluate the effectiveness of various barriers. The ultimate goal is to provide Border Patrol agents ample time to respond to incidents of illegal drugs and human smuggling across the border. Though the officials plan to build between four to eight prototypes, they did not specify an exact date for the construction's initiation.

According to Ronald D. Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner at Customs and Border Protection, San Diego was chosen as the ideal location because the land is owned by the government, easily accessible, and offers a practical real-world environment for testing.

It is important to note that there are currently no plans to build a wall stretching across the entire 1,900 miles of the Mexican border, as confirmed by both John F. Kelly, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and Mr. Vitiello. Furthermore, the agency has determined that approximately 130 miles within this vast border region would not be suitable for a border wall due to geographic challenges such as bodies of water and difficult terrain.

In January, President Trump issued an executive order for a border wall, resulting in Customs and Border Protection requesting proposals for both a concrete wall and alternate wall types in March. The agency has received hundreds of bids for prototypes but has yet to make a final decision on the vendors.

Despite the submitted proposals, funding for the border wall was not included in the congressional spending bill. However, Homeland Security officials allocated $20 million from other department programs to finance the prototypes. The San Diego area and the Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas have been identified as priority locations for new border walls.

The construction of a border wall featured prominently in a heated budget dispute earlier this year. The Trump administration sought $3.6 billion for the project, covering the 2017 and 2018 budgets and approximately 100 miles of wall. However, Congress, consisting of both Democrats and Republicans, rejected the requested sum, opting instead to increase funding to expand border security technology.

Customs and Border Protection has specified several design requirements to be addressed by the vendors, including anti-climb measures and a minimum depth of six feet below ground to discourage digging or tunneling.

Despite the desire for an imposing and secure wall, Homeland Security officials have expressed the importance of maintaining a visually appealing aesthetic, at least from the American side.

It should be noted that numerous communities near the border areas, particularly in Texas, have voiced strong opposition to the idea of building a wall. Bipartisan opposition has emerged from most of Texas's congressional delegation, with Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, questioning the effectiveness of a border wall, stating, "I don’t think we’re just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it."
