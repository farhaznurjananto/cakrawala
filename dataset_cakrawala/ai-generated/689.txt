E-commerce company Overstock.com's shares have the potential to soar by over 60%, according to Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. Forte is currently the only analyst listed on FactSet who covers the e-commerce company, which has managed to top $1 billion in market value only in the last few weeks.

During a recent earnings call, Overstock hinted at the possibility of selling its home e-commerce business. In response, Forte has raised his target price on the stock from $57 a share to $85, citing two key reasons for his bullish outlook.

Firstly, Forte identified the potential for unlocking value from Overstock's home e-commerce efforts, which have been performing well.

Secondly, Forte highlighted the importance of Medici Ventures, Overstock's blockchain-focused division, which was launched in 2014. Owning a portfolio of nine companies that leverage blockchain technology to varying degrees, Medici Ventures is considered to be one of Overstock's most valuable assets. Yet, Forte believes that the market still does not fully recognize the value this division brings to the company.

Blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin and other digital currencies, has been attracting increasing attention from Wall Street this year. Independent investor and long-time short seller Marc Cohodes cited Overstock's involvement in blockchain when he predicted in October that shares of the e-commerce company could reach $100.

Overstock, an online retailer of home goods and clothing, has quietly invested in and developed businesses that focus on digital currencies and their blockchain technology. Shares in the company leaped 31% to $52.40 on Thursday, while there remains about 62% potential gain needed to reach Forte's target. The shares continued their upward trajectory on Friday, rising more than 5% and on pace for gains of more than 20% for the week.

Late on Wednesday, Overstock reported a diluted net loss per share of 3 cents in the third quarter, which is an improvement compared to the 12-cent loss per share in the same quarter last year. Although the Medici division posted a pretax loss of $3.7 million, a figure greater than the $3 million reported in the same period last year, the overall performance was better than expected.

Overstock's stock has surged in recent weeks following CEO Patrick Byrne's announcement that the company's majority-owned subsidiary, tZero, is launching a digital coin-trading platform. Overstock holds a license for a U.S. alternative trading system, and the news has drawn attention to the company's blockchain development work.

It is worth noting that Overstock's third-quarter earnings release stated that Quantum Partners, a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management, had bought a $4 million warrant to purchase nearly 10% of Overstock's common shares at $40.45 each by early January.
