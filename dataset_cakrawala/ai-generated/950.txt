The black civil rights movement spread across the country, and as more and more African-Americans fought for equal rights, more racists fought against them.  In the midst of this movement, Jane Elliott, a white teacher from a predominantly white town in Iowa, has seen the world around her fight in the streets of cities like Atlanta, Chicago, and Atlanta. and Washington DC. equality for all people, men and women, regardless of their race. But how?  
 And then, one night in April 1968, a gunshot rang out in Memphis, Tennessee. As Jane Elliott watched the media cover the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., she was appalled by the fact that white reporters didn't seem to understand what the black community was going through. 
  Elliott realized  the problem was the disconnect between what whites know about racism and what blacks are going through. So Elliott developed an exercise to change the way his white students think about racism.
