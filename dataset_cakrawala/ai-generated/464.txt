In the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester, Pennsylvania, an alleged prostitute and her male accomplice were arrested for robbing a home after the customer did not pay for sexual services. Monica DeJesus, 22, and Justin Harris, 36, are now in custody at Chester County jail facing multiple charges, including robbery, conspiracy, and the promotion of prostitution.

According to Philly.com, the incident occurred when DeJesus and Harris went to the residence in East Goshen Township around 5:30 a.m. on Sunday. It is reported that the pair decided to rob the house as a form of retaliation. Harris, armed with a gun, forcefully kicked in the door to gain entry, only to be overpowered by one of the two residents inside. The resident managed to defend himself, striking Harris in the face with a fireplace poker. 

At this point, DeJesus took over the situation, picking up the dropped gun and pointing it at the same resident, while the other managed to run away before any harm could come to them. Despite the dangerous encounter, the duo managed to take away some unspecified property from the home.

Following the incident, police were able to locate and apprehend the couple a short time later. Both suspects were found with the stolen gun and other property taken from the residence. Chester County jail will hold DeJesus and Harris until their trial, with court records not yet showing listings for defense attorneys.

The case highlights the potential dangers and repercussions related to illegal activities. With charges pending against DeJesus and Harris, the two must now face the consequences of their actions as the justice system works to determine the appropriate outcome.
