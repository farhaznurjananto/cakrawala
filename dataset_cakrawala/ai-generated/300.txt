Elizabeth May, the lawyer, environmental activist, and leader of the Green Party of Canada, gave her insights on climate change during the Scaling Up 2017 bioeconomy conference in Ottawa held last November 27 to 29. Attendees were eagerly waiting to hear her comments on the recent statement of the US President Donald Trump about the country's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. May's point was that those who are eager to see action on climate change have nothing to fear from the US withdrawal. May had already been at the recent 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bonn and her analysis was almost certainly based on conversations with environmental policy analysts from around the world.

May pointed out that the US has not pulled out of the UNFCCC, despite withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. Meaning, the US will stay involved in the work of the UNFCCC, and there will be an opportunity for the country to re-engage with the rest of the world in the Paris Agreement if it chooses to do so in the future. May was convinced that President Trump's efforts to revive the coal industry in the US will come to nothingness as decisions to move away from coal have already been made, and utilities are not going to return to coal-fired generation where it has already been phased out.

May also explained the Talanoa dialogue. Talanoa is a Fijian word for transparency, inclusiveness, and accountability, elements to which the process of inclusive, participatory, and transparent dialogue of the UN climate negotiations will adhere to. It was recently adopted in the 2018 workplan for the Conference of the Parties, "Where Are We Now, Where Do We Need To Be, and How Do We Get To Where We Need To Be?" In May's opinion, the efforts that President Trump made to derail the Paris Agreement have been a failure. Regardless of all countries achieving their Nationally Determined Contribution, this will not suffice to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. On October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will present a detailed pathway on what needs to be done globally to achieve the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement.
