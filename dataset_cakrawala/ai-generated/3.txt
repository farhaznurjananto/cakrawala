One of Obamacare's biggest selling points was that it would bring down the cost of health insurance.

"If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period," Obama promised. "No one will take it away, no matter what."

Not everyone is keeping their plan, as a new report from the American Academy of Actuaries finds that, "in the short run at least, health insurance coverage will become more expensive for some people."

According to the report, some customers are already seeing their premiums skyrocket by as much as 100 percent.

"While some consumers will receive subsidies to help them pay the higher premiums, others will feel the full brunt of the increases," the report notes. "The subsidies, while substantial, are not large enough to cover all of the additional costs, and some people will find the net premium unaffordable, despite the subsidies."

Some consumers will pay more for their insurance and also be forced to purchase plans with more benefits than they need or want, something that was possible before Obamacare.

The report notes that some Americans will be able to afford their insurance, but will be forced to switch to a plan they don't want.

"In addition, many people who are able to purchase coverage on the individual market will find that the plans available to them have increased premiums and fewer benefits," the report says. "This reflects market forces in the marketplace, and it is not due to any actions taken by the Obama Administration."

The report also finds that, "over the long run, the net effect of the Affordable Care Act on the cost of health insurance will be positive."

That's not what the people who voted for Obamacare are hearing.

The report found that, "increasingly, people are finding it more difficult to afford the coverage they have."

This is exactly what Obamacare was supposed to prevent.

Obama was promising that people would be able to keep their insurance, but that's not what's happening.

The Affordable Care Act is causing premiums to skyrocket and forcing people to buy plans they don't want.

This is not what Obama promised.

 Obamacare is a disaster. Get it repealed.
