The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), a prominent national watchdog organization focusing on the separation of church and state, has issued a letter on October 27 to the Covington County Commission in Andalusia, Alabama. The letter condemns the commission's unconstitutional allocation of $3,000 in county funds to the Covington Baptist Association.

On October 8, the commission had voted to provide $3,000 in taxpayer funds to the Baptist group, with the aim of initiating a monthly men's ministry program. According to the Andalusia Star News, the primary goal of the program is "to get more men to church."

Katherine Paige, a legal fellow at FFRF, sent the letter to the commission, outlining the reasons why the grant is deemed unconstitutional. She quoted the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits "sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activities."

Paige further argued that funding a Baptist ministry contradicts the principle of neutrality, particularly when the program is explicitly Christian and designed to persuade people to convert to Christianity. In response, FFRF has requested the commission to revoke the grant and reclaim the $3,000 from the ministry.

FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor stated that there could not be a more blatant violation of the Constitution than providing a direct cash donation to a Christian ministry with the intent of promoting church attendance. The organization also pointed out that the Alabama Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of taxes or any public funds for the purpose of maintaining a minister or ministry (Ala. Const. Art. ยง 3).

In addition to the letter, FFRF sent an open records request seeking documentation related to the donation, as well as any communications between the county and the Covington Baptist Association.

FFRF, headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, is the nation's largest association of freethinkers, including atheists and agnostics. The organization maintains a strong presence in Alabama, with its longest-active chapter, the Alabama Freethought Association, meeting at the FFRF's Freethought Hall near Talladega, where a monument dedicated to "Atheists in Foxholes" is displayed.
