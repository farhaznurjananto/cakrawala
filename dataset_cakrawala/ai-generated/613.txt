Bernie Sanders' 2017 personal finance disclosure forms have revealed that his income surpassed $1 million last year. This includes his $174,000 annual salary as a Senator and $858,750 earned from book royalties, such as the nearly $800,000 advance for his book, Our Revolution. The Economic Policy Institute states that the threshold separating the wealthiest 1% of Americans by annual income is $389,436. This places Sanders' income within the top one-fifth of 1% in the country, according to US Census data.

The average wealth of US senators and representatives has risen dramatically in recent years, leading to the labeling of Congress as a "millionaire's club." In 2014, the average personal wealth across both houses of Congress exceeded $1 million for the first time in history. Few members of Congress, however, have been able to accrue as much wealth as Bernie Sanders did in a single year. 

Sanders' book royalties alone would have been the third-highest outside income in the Senate in 2014, as reported by opensecrets.org. First place went to fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren, whose income reached $1.2 million. However, this is not the first year that Sanders' income has approached the top 1% threshold; for years, his income has consistently been in the low-to-mid six figures range.

Despite his claims to be leading a political revolution against the billionaire class, Sanders has attracted attention for not advocating for key socialist measures, such as the nationalization of industries. Furthermore, he has supported American imperialism and fostered nationalism, creating tensions between American workers and their international counterparts.

In the Democratic National Convention, Sanders presented his support for Hillary Clinton's campaign as a continuation of his so-called "political revolution." After the Democratic Party suffered losses in the November election, Sanders collaborated with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and former Obama cabinet member Tom Perez in their nationwide campaign efforts.

The Democratic Party now faces concerns that their focus on the campaign against Russia and Trump may pave the way for a mass popular movement beyond their control, potentially threatening capitalism. Despite these uncertainties, Sanders continues to support the Democrats' allegations of Russian collusion with Trump. With the political and economic landscape of the United States evolving rapidly, it remains to be seen how Sandersâ€™ political services will unfold.
