Nonesuch Store is a popular digital platform that offers the public the chance to access a vast collection of music and movies. Since its official launch in December 2007, the online store has grown amazingly to offer more than just a few releases but has become a showcase for Nonesuch albums. Presently, the store boasts of hundreds of classic and latest albums, available in various formats such as CDs, instant album MP3 downloads, vinyl, and DVDs.

The digital platform offers numerous collections including soundtracks from the latest Coen brothers’ films, albums from artists like Chris Thile and Ry Cooder, and debut releases from Devendra Banhart, Iron and Wine, and Bombino - a comprehensive package of amazing music to suit different needs. Customers can enjoy an immersive experience by watching DVDs like the video "liner notes" to Jeremy Denk's recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations, which the Wall Street Journal calls "the kind of fresh thinking of which we can never have too much."

Nonesuch Store was established to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the store. As part of the celebration, an incredible discount of up to 34% off the standard retail price (SRP) is available for all CDs, LPs, and DVDs on the website. This hefty discount is an additional saving of up to 20% off the everyday prices on display on the Nonesuch website and will reflect in the final cart total at checkout.

Aside from the promotional discount, the Nonesuch Store also has more than 800 albums available as high-quality MP3s, including classic recordings no longer in print. In addition, audiophiles will be excited to know that dozens of FLAC lossless files of their latest album releases are available for download.

With the ongoing discount, customers can purchase albums from their favorite artists at barely a fraction of the original cost. Also, customers can enjoy holiday sales such as Christmas sales, New Year sales and other special deals throughout the year. To access the broad array of amazing albums and take advantage of the 34% discount on all Nonesuch CDs, LPs, and DVDs, head to the Nonesuch Store by visiting nonesuch.com/store.
