Jane Elliott is an educator whose 1968 classroom experiment on prejudice, A Class Divided, is one of television's most acclaimed documentaries.

Elliott was born on May 25, 1933, in Riceville, Iowa. She was a student at the University of Northern Iowa and a teacher in the Iowa public school system.

Elliott's famous classroom experiment was an outgrowth of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. After the assassination, Elliott's third grade class was having a difficult time coping with the tragedy. In an effort to help her students understand the events, Elliott held a classroom experiment on prejudice.

In the experiment, Elliott divided her class into two groups: the blue-eyed group and the brown-eyed group. The blue-eyed group was given special privileges and told that they were better than the brown-eyed group. The brown-eyed group was told that they were inferior to the blue-eyed group.

The experiment was conducted over the course of a day. At the end of the day, the roles were reversed and the brown-eyed group was given the special privileges.

The experiment was captured on film by PBS and aired as a documentary in 1970. The documentary, A Class Divided, received critical acclaim and is still watched today.

Elliott retired from teaching in 1990 and now resides in Iowa City, Iowa. She is a member of the Iowa Academy of Science and Arts.

Elliott was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004. She is also a recipient of the National Medal of Science.

In 2006, Elliott released her memoir, A Class Divided: My Life in the Middle School Classroom. The book was critically acclaimed and won the Iowa Book Award for Nonfiction.

Elliott is also known for her work on anti- bullying campaigns. She is a founding member of the National Council on Bullying Prevention and was a key figure in the development of the national anti- bullying campaign, It's On Us.

Elliott is a powerful advocate for social justice and has made important contributions to the field of education. She is a true pioneer in the field of documentary filmmaking and has helped to change the way we think about prejudice and social justice.
