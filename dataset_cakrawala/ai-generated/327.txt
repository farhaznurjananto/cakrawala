Recently, Westinghouse Electric Company's announcement of filing for bankruptcy sent shockwaves throughout the nuclear power industry. It wasn't exactly a secret that the company was struggling with financial issues due to cost overruns and schedule delays at two nuclear construction projects in Georgia and South Carolina. However, when rumors became facts, the stakes were substantially elevated. As a result, it became unclear if the four AP1000 reactor projects would ever be completed, which led anti-nuclear groups to lobby for the units to be scrapped.

One of the speakers, Peter Bradford, an adjunct law professor, former chairman of the Maine and New York Public Utility Commissions, and former commissioner with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, posed questions as to whether cost overruns, construction delays and bankruptcy should have been foreseen. He said that Vogtle Units 1 and 2 overran original cost estimates by billions of dollars three decades ago. Furthermore, he said many northeastern states and every state in a crescent from the Carolinas to Washington state had at least one, nine-figure nuclear cost overrun in the 1970s or 1980s. Likewise, all of those plants were delayed by at least a year, and some by more than a decade.

In fact, by the mid-1980s, nuclear power was considered by many people to be the greatest disaster in business history. More than half of all units ever planned in the U.S. were canceled outright. Vogtle became the US’s reference AP1000 plant by default after Bellefonte Units 3 and 4 were delayed to the point of cancellation. It should be noted that Bellefonte Units 1 and 2 were never completed either. Bradford suggested the AP1000 projects should only be allowed to continue if costs to complete the units are determined to be less than obtaining the same energy in alternative ways.

Although Bradford is a skeptic, not everyone is cynical about the future of nuclear power. Bryan Hanson, President and Chief Nuclear Officer for Exelon Nuclear, gave the keynote address during the 2017 ELECTRIC POWER Conference & Exhibition on April 11 in Chicago, where he focused on the future of nuclear energy.

Exelon operates the most significant nuclear fleet in the country with 23 reactors across 14 locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland. Hanson acknowledged that the industry has seen its share of challenges such as rising costs, falling energy prices, market inequities, increased regulation, and a lack of federal and state energy policies that value the critical infrastructure that nuclear power plants provide. Nonetheless, he remains "passionate" about the future of nuclear energy.

Although Exelon isn't considering any new units at this time, the company is participating in working groups to help develop next-generation nuclear designs to help keep the U.S. nuclear industry relevant. Additionally, Hanson believes that it's essential to finish the AP1000 projects.

Hanson believes that "It is vital to show the American public…that we know how to construct nuclear power plants", and that it is important for the industry to rally around Westinghouse and those two projects that are being constructed to make sure they move forward. Nonetheless, Exelon's priority remains saving current facilities rather than building new ones: “We need to make sure we preserve our existing U.S. nuclear plants. They’re so critical to the infrastructure of this nation that we must do everything that we can to protect those”, Hanson said.

Furthermore, in recent times, nuclear power prices have made it less competitive when compared to the increased competition from natural gas and other renewable energy sources. It has become increasingly difficult for the industry to compete, which is why many states like New York and Illinois have turned to subsidizing its costs; however, such calls by businesses to “Save the Nukes” may fall on deaf ears in Georgia and South Carolina. Electricity rates have already risen for SCANA and Southern Co. customers as a result of the nuclear construction projects, and both companies must evaluate their options. If both AP1000 projects were to be abandoned, it would take a game-changing development for any US power company to seriously consider a new nuclear construction project ever again.
