Roboticists at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, have created a robot with a tail to improve its stability and maneuverability during high-speed turns. The robot, named Dima, was purposely designed with a high center of mass to help achieve its straight-line speed. However, turning at high speeds can lead to the robot tipping over. The addition of an actuated tail helps counteract the torque generated by the turn and keeps the robot stable.

The researchers were inspired by the way a cheetah's tail moves when making high-speed turns. Rather than generating torque, the tail swings in the roll axis of the robot to counteract torque. Unlike previous tail-assisted turns, where the tail is used to generate torque to turn the robot, the new tail system helps keep the robot stable during turns. The researchers tested both tail-less and tailed versions of Dima and found that the addition of the actuated tail allowed the robot to make stable turns at more than twice the speed it would have reached without the tail; 7.5 m/s compared to 3.1 m/s, respectively.

This tail technology provides ample advantages to the robot's movement, as Dima can now turn more efficiently and safely at a high-speed. The actuated tail enables the robot to swing back and forth to help the robot move smoothly when turning, thus preventing it from toppling over. The researchers believe this technology can be applied in other fields of robotics, such as automated cars or drones, as well as improving robots' mobility in search and rescue missions.

The vision of such advancements is that it could soon pave the way for the development of more intelligent and adaptable robots that can operate in environments deemed dangerous or challenging for humans. The researchers have urged for more investment in tail technology, as its potential is limitless.

This research poses questions on whether tail technology could be implemented in other areas of robotics. However, adherence to ethical guidelines and regulations for testing and improving these technologies will remain crucial.
