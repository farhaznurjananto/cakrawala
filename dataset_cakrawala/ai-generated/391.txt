Since the 2016 US Presidential election, allegations of Russian interference have been circulating. Specifically, it is alleged that the Russian government breached the servers of the Democratic National Committee, stole emails and other documents, and released them to the public. However, the evidence supporting these assertions may not be as substantial as originally believed.

The security firm Crowdstrike was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate some unusual network activity on their servers. These investigations uncovered two separate intrusions, which were then named Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Crowdstrike suggested that both these intruders were Russian. However, such claims are difficult to substantiate directly. Although the techniques used in the hack appear to resemble those used by past attacks attributed to Russia, once the malware is deployed, it tends to be picked up by cybercriminals and offered for sale or trade. And with the ease of modifying the code used, it is hard to establish with certainty that Russia carried out the attack.

Furthermore, Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for the hack, suggesting it was a lone, unconnected actor involved in the data breach. However, metadata from a PDF file indicated that the last person to save the document did so under a username featuring Cyrillic letters. Moreover, invalid hyperlink error messages generated in Russian also appeared during the save process from Microsoft Word to PDF. These metadata indicators would appear to all but point to Russian involvement. That said, discovered mistakes are somewhat amateurish considering the sophistication of the hack, and it's plausible that the evidence may have been planted to deflect attention from the true perpetrators.

Finally, attribution is a challenging issue in cybersecurity. Once a threat is released into the wild, it is difficult to control its spread, and it is inevitable that people will analyze and adapt it for their own purposes. No evidence can link an attacker to an attack irrefutably. Thus, for this reason, it remains uncertain that Russia is responsible for the hack at the DNC servers.
