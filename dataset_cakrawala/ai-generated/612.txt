In my previous article, I discussed the variety of dismissive arguments made against atheists and atheism, which I referred to as "Shut up, that's why" arguments. In this article, I will delve into the possible origins of these arguments and how differing perspectives on curiosity can play a role in these discussions.

Last week, an interesting story aired on "This American Life," which, although unrelated to atheism, seemed to strike at the core of the "Shut up, that’s why" argument. The story revolved around a family legend about a grandfather who was kidnapped as a child on a camping trip, and later found with his captor. The granddaughter of this man conducted extensive research to uncover the truth behind the event, which led her to another woman who claimed the kidnapped child was, in fact, her own. As the granddaughter continued to investigate, she discovered that the other woman's claim was credible, and DNA testing eventually confirmed it as well. However, when the truth was revealed, her family reacted angrily – not at the ancestors who had taken her grandfather, but at the granddaughter herself for unearthing the truth in the first place.

This story demonstrates the differing perspectives people have towards truth and curiosity. Some people prioritize harmony and contentment in their lives, even if it means not discussing certain topics or asking certain questions. Others, however, are driven by curiosity and cannot help but seek answers to the questions that plague them.

It's important to note that neither perspective is inherently superior to the other, and both types of people have certain valuable qualities. Ideally, a balance between these traits is necessary for a well-rounded individual. The issue arises when individuals with conflicting perspectives engage in difficult discussions, such as the debates between atheists and theists.

Atheists often assume that theists naturally want to seek the truth and that they want to pursue the question of God's existence to its logical conclusion. On the other hand, many theists may assume that atheists are more focused on finding a worldview that is appealing and useful, rather than one that is consistent and plausible. The resulting disconnect can lead to misunderstandings, and potentially, hostility.

One prime example would be the dismissive "Shut up, that's why" arguments against atheists which often revolve around the desire for peace and understanding, rather than insatiable curiosity. Moreover, theists may become unhappy or upset during debates with atheists, as the conversation pushes them outside of their comfort zone regarding faith and God.

The key takeaway is that not all theists are uninterested in exploring complex questions, but when it comes to the subject of God, they may be more inclined to limit their investigations. By understanding these differences in perspective, we can engage in more productive and respectful conversations on this topic, regardless of personal beliefs.
