A California dad has made headlines for confronting his child's school board to speak out against the teaching of Islam in schools. According to reports, there is an increasingly active push to teach the religion in schools in California, which is raising concerns among some parents and educators.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has been leading the push to teach Islam in schools, citing the need to fight "Islamophobia" as a reason for promoting the curriculum. However, critics argue that teaching Islam to children is unconstitutional and sends a dangerous message to young students.

The San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) is one of the school districts under scrutiny for its handling of the issue. With a long history of yielding to Islamic demands and recent, more alarming submissions, San Diego city schools appear to be the ground zero for Islamic indoctrination within American public schools. 

The current programme, a collaboration with CAIR, aims to implement an anti-bullying campaign aimed at protecting Muslim students. However, critics have argued that the programme promotes a biased view of Islam and sends a dangerous message to young students.

Janet Levy, writing for American Thinker, has raised concerns over the SDUSD's decision to adopt what she calls an Islam-centric curriculum. In her article, she writes, "If allowed to stand, the SDUSD anti-bullying program – geared specifically to the CAIR-identified needs of Muslim students – could mark a dangerous departure from treasured constitutional principles and First Amendment protections. This case warrants serious attention, as it has grave implications for the direction of education and the supremacy of Islam in the nation."

One of the most worrisome issues for parents and educators is that a Christian trying to push Christianity on children would be heavily criticized, if not outright condemned. However, there appears to be little resistance to the push to teach Islam in schools. This has raised concerns among some groups, who argue that the move is tantamount to indoctrination.

American Thinker reported on the issue, stating: "With a decade-long history of yielding to Islamic demands and recent, more alarming submissions, San Diego city schools appear to be ground zero for Islamic indoctrination within American public schools. The current capitulation includes an Islam-centric curriculum with input and resources from a Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated organization, which raises First Amendment issues as well as serious concerns of favoritism toward Muslim students over students of other faiths."

San Diego public schools have been particularly accommodating of Muslim students, with one school adding Arabic to its curriculum and altering lunch periods to accommodate Muslim prayer. The most recent program, a collaboration with CAIR, implemented an anti-bullying campaign aimed at protecting Muslim students, but has been criticised by some for promoting a biased view of Islam.

Critics argue that the push to teach Islam in schools is unconstitutional and sends a dangerous message to young students. Some groups warn that this is just the beginning and that if action is not taken, Islamic indoctrination could soon become commonplace in American schools.
