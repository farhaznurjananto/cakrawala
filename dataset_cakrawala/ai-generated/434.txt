Investor Promotion: 25% Discount on Tyroler Glückspilze Products

Tyroler Glückspilze, a brand owned by Mushroom Production Center GmbH, has been producing high-quality organic mushroom products since 2012. The company has been at the forefront of research and innovation in mushroom production. In the past, 95% of the edible mushrooms consumed in Austria were imported from foreign countries, mostly from conventional farming practices. However, the demand for locally grown organic mushrooms has been increasing. Tyroler Glückspilze is the only supplier in Austria to offer such a wide range of organic mushroom products, and the company aims to continue innovating and expanding its product line by collaborating with research facilities and universities in the future.

To reward investors who have invested more than 500 euros in Tyroler Glückspilze, the company offers a 25% discount on all self-produced goods in their online shop. The offer also applies to all existing investors. However, the discount applies only to end-consumer purchases and not to wholesale or bulk pricing.

Tyroler Glückspilze offers a range of products, including mushroom substrates for organic mushroom cultivation, dietary supplements made from organic vital mushrooms, and mycorrhiza plant fertilizers. The company plans to add more products to its portfolio in the future. All products are available for purchase at the online shop.

Mushrooms are more than just a culinary delight. They have immense potential in fields such as medicine, soil and water restoration, pest control, and cosmetics. In collaboration with the MRCA Mushroom Research Center Austria and universities, Tyroler Glückspilze aims to research and develop innovative products and commercialize them.

The business model of Tyroler Glückspilze involves selling mushroom substrates to mushroom farmers, who grow and sell the mushrooms to retailers. Tyroler Glückspilze provides farmers with the necessary training and equipment needed for mushroom cultivation. The brand's substrates enable farmers to achieve a 20% higher yield in a 50% shorter growth cycle than substrates from other suppliers.

The company's dietary supplements contain health-promoting substances, including polysaccharides, triterpenes, vitamins, and minerals found in some mushrooms. While vital mushrooms have been used in traditional medicine in Asia for thousands of years, they have only recently gained popularity in Europe. Tyroler Glückspilze's organic vital mushroom dietary supplements offer customers 100% Tyrolean-made bio-quality, which sets them apart from competitors' products, which are mainly imported from Asia.

The mycorrhiza plant fertilizer improves root growth, nutrient uptake, leaf growth, flowering, and yields while reducing water and fertilizer usage and drought stress. The product is sold to professional gardeners, farmers, and through hardware and gardening retailers. Tyroler Glückspilze's mycorrhiza plant fertilizers contain ten times more active mycorrhiza fungi and 1000 times more concentrated than other products available on the market.

Tyroler Glückspilze was created to meet the demand for organic and locally grown mushrooms in Austria as a new branch of agriculture. The company's innovative research and development in mushroom production, in collaboration with the MRCA Mushroom Research Center Austria and universities, has made it a recognized scientific partner of the University of Innsbruck, with its work featured in microbiology, pharmacy, and botany.

In summary, investing in Tyroler Glückspilze is not only rewarding in terms of discounted prices, but it also contributes to the development of a sustainable, organic and locally grown mushroom industry in Austria.
