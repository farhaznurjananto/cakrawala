Ohio has the potential to make cannabis history on November 3 when voters will have the opportunity to legalise personal use of marijuana for adults over the age of 21 and medical marijuana access all at the same time. But the headlines and lobbying groups will tell you that the effort, run by ResponsibleOhio, has been mired in controversy from the start, and not because it would tax and regulate pot, but because of who would profit from it. A group of wealthy backers formed ResponsibleOhio last year, spending more than $2m to gather the 305,000 petition signatures needed to qualify their initiative for the ballot. Now they are spending millions more to win and amend Ohio's state constitution. Designated “Issue 3”, the proposal was certified by Ohio Secretary of State, John A. Hustead, on 12 August, but its details have been sharply criticised.

The sticking point in Issue 3 is its provision that just 10 businesses would grow all of the state's legal cannabis, with those contracts not up for bid. The owners of those businesses are the ones funding the campaign. The textbook definition of a cartel is “an association of manufacturers or suppliers with the purpose of maintaining prices at a high level and restricting competition.” Legal marijuana cartels already exist in states such as New Jersey and New York, which have licensed a handful of businesses to supply medical marijuana, and some say is a route the cannabis may take elsewhere. But many industry insiders and local grassroots cannabis activists are shying away from backing Issue 3 because there's nothing ‘responsible’ about such a cartel.

The usual adversaries-prosecutors, police and drug-prevention groups have come out strongly against Issue 3. They aren’t the only ones, Ohio Governor John Kasich has opposed it, along with pretty much the entire Ohio legislature, who have rolled out the usual and often false assertions about the dangers of legalisation. However, the opposition’s main message is that it will create a cartel at the wholesale level. A long list of business groups, trade associations and even pro-marijuana organisations have united in their distaste for this form of ending cannabis prohibition.

Reform groups such as NORML and the MPP have thrown some support towards Issue 3, but have done so cautiously. In a letter to NORML’s membership, founder Keith Stroup explains their reason for backing Issue 3, albeit with reservations. "The NORML board felt obliged to hold our noses and endorse Issue 3 in Ohio. It was, as the saying goes, "a bitter pill to swallow," and the board wanted to make it clear we do not consider the Ohio proposal the best model for other states to follow. There are far better ways to legalise marijuana. Most of us would prefer to keep the focus on protecting personal freedom and ending marijuana arrests.”

Amendment 64 in Colorado similarly amended that the state constitution, taking an end-run around the legislature. Designated “Issue 3” it does the same and therefore politicians have little or no say in how the measure would get implemented, and no control over how the potentially large tax windfall would be distributed. Backed by millions of dollars of investor funding, ResponsibleOhio is forging ahead with its approach to cannabis legalisation. With a garish character mascot named “Buddie” introduced in August to appeal to the college crowd, ResponsibleOhio certainly isn’t part of the cannabis establishment in Ohio, which sees Issue 3 as the worst kind of cannabis capitalism.
