Andrew Hales, an American prankster, posted another video of himself performing a "social experiment" in Chengdu. Click here to watch the video on YouTube. Instead of stealing strangers' umbrellas, it's holding strangers' hands this time. Hales's success rate at getting people to hold his hand doesn't seem to be as high as getting people to let go of their umbrellas, but a few play along good-naturedly not nearly as many who give him dirty looks, scream, or jump away in horror. The following are some of the online reactions to Hales' China videos, which are part of his larger body of work shot in various locations around the world: Within the first two days of its release, the holding hands video received over one million views on YouTube. The umbrella video#, on the other hand, seemed to elicit a number of venomous comments. Meanwhile, Hales wrote a blog post about his week-long visit to Chengdu, detailing every fresh-off-the-plane-young-white-first guy's reaction to China (everything's so cheap, man! Free alcohol! Girls are adoring me! Because we're white, everyone adores us! Everything is so inexpensive! Toilets that squat! Nobody understands English!) So precisely that it almost appears to be a spoof laowai-in-China blog. But not entirely.
