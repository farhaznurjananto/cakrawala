Longmont police are looking for a 30-year-old man who is accused of attacking his neighbor for no reason early Wednesday morning. The neighbor was seriously hurt. Police say the last time they saw Kurt Severen Olson Jones was around 3:20 p.m., when he was going south on I-25 from Colo. Highway 119 in the Longmont area. Jones is wanted on a warrant for second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, second-degree assault causing serious bodily injury, and aggravated robbery, said Longmont Police Cmdr. Jeff Satur in a news release on Wednesday evening. The bond for the warrant is $75,000. After a fight was reported in the area on Wednesday morning, Jones Jones locked himself in his house at 2130 Meadow Court. The police went to his porch after getting a second call about a disturbance. They found a broken window and a cell phone that had been left there. The victim, a 48-year-old man who lived near Jones, was taken to Longmont United Hospital to get help. "It was a pretty serious attack, and it was pretty violent," Satur said. The man told the police that he was attacked and strangled on his way home from work. He told the police that he didn't know the person who hurt him. His "vascular injuries" were so bad that the police called the attack an attempt to kill him at first, even though that charge is not on the arrest warrant. When Jones barricaded himself in his fourplex, Longmont SWAT officers were sent to help. Longmont's SWAT team surrounded the house, and officers tried to talk to Jones. However, Satur said Jones wouldn't cooperate and wouldn't come out or let officers into his house. Satur said, "Negotiations is kind of a strong word" because "we did all the talking" and the resident didn't say anything. Because the victim couldn't name Jones as his attacker at first, the police stayed away from his house so they could keep looking into the case. Jones came out in the end and talked to police officers after noon, Satur said. Later Wednesday afternoon, the police got the warrant for arrest. After the SWAT call was taken away late Wednesday morning, facilities in the area that had been put on lockdown went back to normal. He said he couldn't say much about Jones' mental health or police record because the investigation didn't have enough evidence as of early Wednesday afternoon. "There is some history there, and I cant' really go into the details at this point," he said. "If we were able to make an arrest, we might be able to share that information." Jones is a white man who is 5 feet 6 inches tall, has brown hair, and has hazel eyes. The last time anyone saw him, he was driving away from Longmont in a red Mustang GT with the license plate 296-XAF. "We'll keep an eye on the suspect's house and try to get him to turn himself in," Satur told the media in an email on Wednesday night.
