 An investigation into the rape conviction of Welsh footballer Ched Evans has been launched by the body investigating possible judicial miscarriages of justice. 
  Evans was convicted in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman at the Premier Inn near Lille, Denbigshire last May.  
 The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said in October it would speed up the investigation but said it would not disclose why.  
 The investigation could last 35 weeks.  
 The former Sheffield United player was released from prison in October after serving half of his five-year sentence.  A spokesman for the CCRC said, "Evans is relatively well-known as a football professional, or for some reason outside the specific facts of the case, the case was not prioritized. 
 “Such prioritization is not common, but it is by no means unprecedented. 
 “We are prioritizing applications as needed and will prioritize one or he two cases each month if consistent with our policy.”
