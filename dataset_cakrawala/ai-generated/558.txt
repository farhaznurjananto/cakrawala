The United Nations General Assembly has commenced, featuring historic sessions with an all-star lineup of autocrats, princes, and populists, some of whom rarely attend the annual event. This year's gathering includes the first visit by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in seven years, as well as Xi Jinping's first as President of China. President Putin of Russia, who last attended a decade ago, will address the assembly on Monday morning, shortly after President Obama's speech, which is expected to be one of the most closely watched.

This year's General Assembly will see the first meeting between Putin and Obama in nearly a year, with the Russian envoy to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, expressing hope for an improvement in frayed relations between the two countries. "I don't think it's a second Cold War. But it's very uncomfortable," Churkin said in a recent interview.

Syria will be front and center in this year's deliberations, with Russia and the United States planning to host rival sessions while discussing countering terrorist groups in the Middle East. High level meetings between the foreign ministers of all five permanent members of the UNSC (Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United States) will also address the Syrian crisis at a lunch hosted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The ongoing conflicts in Syria, Darfur (western Sudan), Yemen, and Libya, are anticipated to be major topics during the General Assembly, often involving the participation of regional and world powers. Gerard van Bohemen, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, criticized the lack of collective action, stating, "Everybody is saying, 'Somebody else has to do something.' No one is saying, 'What can we do?'"
