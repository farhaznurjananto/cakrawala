The decision to reject a $14bn bailout package for the US automobile industry has been branded "one of the darkest days" in Senate history. Senate Majority leader, Harry Reid, warned of the disastrous consequences of allowing US car makers to go bankrupt, ahead of the vote. He said: "This is going to be a very, very bad Christmas for a lot of people as a result of what takes place here tonight." 

The Senate failed to win the 60 votes necessary to proceed with the bill, with the final vote tallying 52 to 35 in favour. Republicans' reluctance to support the bill was largely due to their belief the bailout would place taxpayers' money in danger. Senate Minority leader, Mitch McConnell, expressed sympathy towards the difficulties the car makers were experiencing but said the majority of Republicans felt the bill would not be effective in alleviating the problems. Senators were opposed to the bailout plan that would have given $14 bn of loans to the struggling car companies, General Motors and Chrysler, in exchange for significant operational reforms such as giving the government stakes in the companies.

Many industry and government officials expressed disappointment and frustration with the move, calling it a disaster for the US automobile industry. Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called on the US Government to use the Treasury's larger financial system stabilisation fund to rescue the US car industry, however there was confusion around whether there would be enough funds remaining to do so. Opponents are calling for a renegotiation of the legislation with harsher requirements for receiving federal aid. The bailout's failure promptly increased the likelihood of a General Motors bankruptcy filing at the earliest possible opportunity whilst also increasing the chances of its rival Chrysler suffering the same fate after the holiday period. And furthermore, Ford Motor, which is notÂ as vulnerable as its two rivals, has warned that its own prospects would be damaged if one or both of the other firms go bankrupt.
