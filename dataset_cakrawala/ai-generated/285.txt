On Sunday last week, in the game against the Bears, the Philadelphia Eagles had their first punt. Donnie Jones hit the ball perfectly, and Joe Walker downed it inside the Bears' 10-yard line, setting up the Eagles' defense for a good start.

For the Eagles rookie receiver, Shelton Gibson, the punt was special. It was the first NFL snap of his career, and he used a quick movement to beat his man. Unfortunately, Joe Walker got to the ball first. If the ball had bounced towards Gibson, he could have downed it. Gibson was still pleased with his performance, and he hopes to take advantage of more opportunities in the future.

Gibson has spent the majority of his time as a part of the practice team, responsible for giving the team's defense the ideal looks in preparation for upcoming games. However, during his time, he has still been required to keep on top of the Eagles' playbook which is like having two jobs, Gibson says. Learning how to be a "pro" from Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith was one thing Gibson took away from his time waiting to play in the NFL.

After being inactive for the first ten games of the season, Gibson found out on Tuesday that he would be active for the game on Sunday. When asked why Gibson was chosen over Marcus Johnson, offensive coordinator Frank Reich said it was to "spread the love a little bit." Reich also said that Gibson had earned his chance by working hard in practice.

During the early part of the training camp, Gibson had a rough time. He dropped numerous passes, probably causing speculation within the team of whether they made the right decision in drafting him in the fifth round. Therefore, finally being able to go onto the field must have felt rewarding for the rookie from West Virginia.

The Eagles are set to revisit CenturyLink Field this weekend, where Nelson Agholor had a memorable and upsetting moment last year. But the mental health day given to Nelson Agholor the following weekend seems to have helped him get back on his feet. Pedersen's decision was not only a turning point for Agholor but also for Pedersen as he had never benched a player prior.

"It's a learning experience for both of us, but he came out of it much better. [He was] a lot more confident when he came out of it, and really from that point on, even the last couple games of the season, began to play like the Nelson Agholor we thought we had." Pedersen said.

A few familiar faces will be on the opposing team this weekend when the Eagles take on Seattle. Matt Tobin and Marcus Smith who played for the Eagles in the past will feature in the game. Smith, who was released from the Eagles in July, has performed much better with the Seahawks having equalled his career-high for sacks this NFL season.
