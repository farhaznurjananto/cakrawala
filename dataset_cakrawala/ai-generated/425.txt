Welcome, fans of 7th Sea!

The 7th Sea team has been hard at work on several projects that will surely excite loyal fans. While John and the other writers are working tirelessly on producing the Core Rulebook’s main text and images, the production team is working on several other things including PDFs, BackerKit, and more.

7th Sea: 1st Edition PDFs

We’re excited to announce that over the weekend, more than 10,000 PDFs were sent out to backers who completed the early Kickstarter survey. We’ll be doing another Backerkit survey later to ask about add-ons but this first survey was mainly to get DrivethruRPG emails for this initial wave of 1st Edition PDFs.

We’re thrilled to see that many of those PDFs have already been downloaded from DTRPG! However, the influx of traffic caused DTRPG to struggle to keep up- but we’re pleased to report that most backers have managed to download their PDFs. If you haven’t received your copy yet, please click on this link to fill out a form for a DTRPG PDF error report. We’ll try to send PDFs throughout the week to those backers who have yet to receive their copies.

Note that we’re still waiting for DTRPG to assign the remaining nine books (Swashbuckling Adventures) to our account. As soon as they are set up with us instead of AEG, we’ll send those out to you as well.

Backerkit Surveys

Another Backerkit survey will be sent out soon, where you can specify your add-ons, select your sourcebooks, and more. We had hoped to have it done by today but we need more time to make sure everything is in order. You can expect the survey this week, though!

In addition to the survey, our team will also be taking preorders through Backerkit. If someone you know missed the campaign, they’ll be able to join in through the preorder page. All additional funds raised in Backerkit will also go towards reaching the last stretch goal at $1.35M.

Writing, Art, and Foreign Licensing Applications

For folks interested in getting involved with the project, we have released three new surveys:

7th Sea: Call for Writers

7th Sea: Call for Artists

7th Sea: Foreign Licensing Bid

The two calls for contributors will be open until April 15th, while the foreign licensing bid will be open until April 22nd. If you’re interested in writing or contributing art, or if you would like to publish 7th Sea in a foreign language, please fill out the appropriate form!

Thank You

As always, we would like to express our gratitude to all our loyal fans. Your patience and support is greatly appreciated. We’re looking forward to making the 7th Sea: Second Edition a reality with your help! Thanks for your enthusiasm and excitement!
