Cleveland Indians Pitcher Comes Out for ‘Pride Night’

Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer came out for Pride Night with a rainbow hat, and the team is getting an outstreaming deal with NBC Sports.

The team has also been embroiled in a controversy over its logo, which is a cartoonish image of a Native American man. The team is considering changing the logo in the wake of the protests against racial injustice that have swept the country.

The Indians have not said how they will celebrate Pride this year, but the team has held Pride Night celebrations in the past. Bauer is one of the team’s most popular players, and his involvement in the event is likely to boost attendance.

NBC Sports is providing the team with an outstreaming deal, which will give the network exclusive rights to all of the team’s digital content, including live and delayed broadcasts, highlights, and commentary.

This is the first time that a major league team has signed an outstreaming deal with NBC Sports. The deal is likely to boost viewership for the team, as well as for NBC Sports programming in general.
