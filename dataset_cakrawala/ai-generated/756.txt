 Walking through the weeds looking for spiders, there was movement and there were Jerusalem crickets. I had given up on  finding it. It moved pretty fast through the weeds and I kept trying to get it out with a stick...not happy! I thought a close-up of the chin would be nice. As he lay on his back and kicked his legs around his fat little tummy, I thought about how  the name  Devil's Baby came about. It really looked like a baby (minus the chin).
