A recent report by ABC News on the US Embassy attack in Benghazi reveals additional documentation that sheds more light into the issue. The report indicates that the talking points related to the attack went through numerous versions with extensive editing that led to the politicized editing of the information about the attack. ABC obtained 12 versions of the talking points drafts which were first written entirely by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and evolved into the final version delivered to Congress and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, before she appeared on five talk shows the Sunday after that attack. Internal White House emails obtained by ABC suggest that the edits were made with considerable input from the State Department. The suspicious changes requested by the State Department included the deletion of references to the Al Qaeda-affiliated group Ansar al-Sharia and alerts about terrorist threats in Benghazi during the months preceding the attack, contradicting Jay Carney's statement that no changes were made to the talking points. The State Department also made specific objections including the paragraph of the talking points drafted earlier by the CIA that pointed out the threat of extremists affiliated with al-Qaida in Benghazi and eastern Libya. Consequently, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney changed his statement that revisions to the talking points were merely ‘stylistic’. 

For some people, it might be unclear why the Obama Administration would manipulate the facts around the attack, especially when they supposedly had nothing to hide. However, according to the new documents obtained by ABC, things become quite clear: the State Department was highly concerned about members of Congress using the information to blame the department for not paying attention to warnings about the attack. Emails sent by State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland reveal that she was highly concerned with the inclusion of the information. For instance, Victoria suggested excluding a paragraph that pointed out that the CIA produced various pieces alerting to the danger posed by the extremist groups affiliated to Al-Qaida in Benghazi, as "members of Congress could use this information against the Department for not paying attention to the warnings." 

This parallel revelation raises more important questions and numerous hearings have been conducted regarding how the department's internal reviews failed to unearth any serious lead in the past. It has become evident that the media can no longer dismiss accurate and well-documented stories as conservative media stories as the latest ABC news report has put a spotlight on the issue. Despite the administration's dishonesty and refusal to address the attack, most media outlets are yet to express any curiosity on the matter. However, any reasonable inquiry into the incident will expose the need for a thorough investigation, which will provide the necessary answers that several parties demand to safeguard truth, justice, and the lives of the Americans who lost their lives in that tragic attack.
