Freeman, Joshua, CP24.com A group of activists for accessibility is coming out against a city staff report that recommends allowing accessible cars to stop in designated bike lanes and cycle tracks. "This will effectively convert bike lanes into parking lanes, crippling the citywide bike infrastructure. I ask the council to reject this proposal "Monday, accessibility advocate Adam Cohoon addressed a news conference. He stated that the proposal will also foster enmity between cyclists and those with disabilities. "This proposal would only exacerbate tensions," remarked Cohoon. "The way to reduce conflict among road users such as myself is to prohibit parking in bike lanes." Burns Wattie, who drives a wheelchair van to accommodate his son who has a disability, also spoke out against the proposal. "My presence in the bicycle lane forces riders into the driving lane on a road where motorists no longer anticipate seeing and encountering cyclists," he explained. The issue occurred during a study requested by Councilwoman Kristy Wong-Tam a year ago. She requested that the staff examine the Sherbourne Street and Wellesley Street bike lanes in terms of accessibility, parking, and other issues. On November 3rd, city staff advised allowing vehicles with accessible parking permits to pick up and drop off people in bike lanes as a means of resolving some of the challenges with accessible drop-offs. Tomorrow, the report will be presented to the city council, and it may have ramifications for how planners approach road space in other sections of the city as Toronto seeks to establish a set of bikeway design rules, which are expected to be finalized within the next year. Nevertheless, accessibility advocates assert that they were not contacted about the proposal and that they do not support it. In an interview with CP24, Walk Toronto's Maureen Coyle stated, "There are solutions the city could have theoretically selected that they didn't even consider." "Our primary concern with this particular recommendation before the council this week is that the community, accessibility advocates, bicycle advocates, and pedestrian advocates were not consulted." She stated that although the answers may not be straightforward, they must be devised "with consideration for all road users." Monday, Wong-office Tam's told CP24 that she will ask city workers to investigate alternative possibilities for including accessibility solutions into the road's design.
