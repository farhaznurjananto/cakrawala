Clothing store PacSun has come under fire this Memorial Day weekend for selling a T-shirt with an upside-down American flag. The controversial item was spotted by Rachel Zawacki-Kuss, a shopper at PacSun's location at Tanger Outlets in Foley, Alabama. She took to the company's Facebook page to express her displeasure, calling the T-shirt "distasteful and disrespectful". Her post has since been shared over 6,000 times and has garnered support from many shoppers. 

PacSun has responded to the backlash, stating that it values artistic and creative expression through the brands it sells in its stores. However, out of respect for individuals who serve their country, the company has decided to stop selling the licensed flag T-shirt and will remove it from its stores and website with immediate effect. In a statement given to E! News, PacSun expressed gratitude for the "extraordinary service" provided by service men and women. 

As a retailer grounded in youth culture, it is clear that PacSun did not intend to offend any individuals with its merchandise. However, this incident highlights the importance of being mindful of cultural values and symbols that hold significance to different groups of people. Retailers must make a concerted effort to avoid any potential offense caused by their products, particularly in the light of rising awareness about cultural sensitivity. By removing the T-shirt from sale, PacSun has taken a step towards acknowledging and respecting the sentiments of those who have sacrificed for their country.
