OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess the physical growth and pubertal development in a group of diabetic children and to evaluate the effect of height at diagnosis, duration of illness, and degree of glycemic control on final height and sexual maturation. DESIGN OF RESEARCH: A group of 72 Sudanese diabetic children, aged 7 to 13, were followed longitudinally from the time they were diagnosed with diabetes until they reached their final height. RESULTS: At diagnosis, the mean height standard deviation scores (SDS) in boys were 0.04 and -0.15 in girls, both of which were higher than their genetic target height (GTH). Between diagnosis and final height, the growth velocity was slow, with a significant reduction in pubertal growth spurt. The average final height attained by these children was lower than their GTH, which contradicts the majority of recently published reports. In this group of diabetic patients, the average age of menarche in girls (15.1 years) and the average age of full sexual maturation in boys (17.2 years) were significantly delayed. This delay in physical growth and pubertal development was associated with the duration of diabetes prior to puberty and the concentration of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The majority of these patients were thin when they were diagnosed with diabetes, with a median BMI of 22, but they experienced a remarkable, progressive weight gain during puberty, which was more noticeable in girls. The weight gain was independent of weight at diagnosis and duration of diabetes, but was positively correlated with the daily dose of insulin and HbA1c concentration. CONCLUSION: Conventional diabetes treatment is associated with physical growth impairment and delayed sexual maturation in diabetic children.
