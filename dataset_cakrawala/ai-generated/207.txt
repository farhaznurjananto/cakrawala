Over the years, professing belief in creationism or rejecting evolution has become a prerequisite for Republican candidates running for political office. This trend was particularly evident in the 2007 Republican presidential debates when three out of the eleven candidates raised their hands, admitting to not accepting evolution. Reinforcing this trend, news from the Houston Chronicle reveals that all the four Republican candidates for Lieutenant Governor support the teaching of creationism in public schools. This comes at a time when Texas has just rejected any incursions of creationism into public school textbooks.

According to the candidates, comparative religion is another critical topic that kids at school should be taught. They notably remarked that creationism, intelligent design, and evolution should be taught in schools. Conversations about what should prevail in a child's life should be left to parents and ministers. With the extraordinary power that lieutenant governors have in Texas, this news has become even more concerning.

The candidates’ views were handily summarized in a Texas Public Radio debate. The Chronicle reports that Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson highlighted that students should be armed with knowledge about creationism, intelligent design, and evolution in schools. Paying good teachers well and exposing kids to creationism is extensively championed for by Texas Agricultural Commissioner Todd Staples. State Senator Dan Patrick passionately believes that Jesus should be taught in schools as children are already exposed to him in church on Sundays. To him, creationism should be heralded and triumphed.  Lt. Gov David Dewhurst is proud of his 2006 landmark school finance bill and is advocating for merit pay. Dewhurst called for all three to be taught regardless of public education systems.

The stance of the four candidates is not only illegal but also unconstitutional since creationism is regarded as teaching religious theories in public schools. However, the candidates appear undeterred about the prospect of violating the constitution. Candidates’ rejection of the established legal position on this issue continues to raise concern among many people.

In summary, the trend among Republican candidates of rejecting evolution and advocating for the teaching of creationism persists. This was evident in the 2007 presidential debates, and it continues in Texas, where all four Republican candidates for Lieutenant Governor support the teaching of creationism in schools.
