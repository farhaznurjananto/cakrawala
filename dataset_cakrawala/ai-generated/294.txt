The Susan B. Anthony List, one of the most prominent anti-abortion rights political action committees, has expressed concern over rumors that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is being considered as a potential running mate for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The rumors surfaced after a story appeared in the Drudge Report, claiming that Rice was “near the top of the list” of potential candidates.

SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser has said that Romney promised to choose a running mate who shared his views on abortion. She expressed her disappointment in a statement released on Friday, "Former Secretary Rice's position on the sanctity of human life makes her an unqualified candidate for Governor Romney to choose as a running mate.” Dannenfelser added, “Throughout the campaign, including at the Palmetto Freedom Forum last September, he has pledged to us in no uncertain terms that he would choose a pro-life running mate. We have taken Governor Romney at his word and therefore believe Secretary Rice will be ruled out of consideration. Secretary Rice's position violates criteria that Governor Romney himself has laid out.”

It is unlikely that Rice will be chosen as running mate given her strongly expressed position that she is “mildly pro-choice” and her subsequent denial of any interest in the role of vice president in a March interview on "Fox and Friends.” It is feasible that Romney staffers may have given the rumor to Matt Drudge in order to create a diversion from recent controversies surrounding Romney's work at Bain Capital after 1999.

During the Palmetto Freedom Forum, Romney was asked if he would choose as a running mate "someone who shares your pro-life and pro-marriage convictions," and he replied affirmatively. This promise could work against Rice’s selection as a candidate, given her pro-choice stance on abortion.

In conclusion, while rumors of Rice's possible selection as a running mate have been floating around, her views on abortion make it improbable that she will be selected by the Romney campaign.
