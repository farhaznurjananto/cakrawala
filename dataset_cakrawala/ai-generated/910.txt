OUR JOURNEY In May of 2015, the SOSV biotech accelerator IndieBio EU provided us with funding despite the fact that all we had was an idea. Because of this, we decided to conduct our preliminary study and get a crash course in the process of creating our firm in Cork, which is located in Ireland. Since then, we've met with key partners in the peanut industry, from farmers and breeders to manufacturers and distributors of peanut products. The advice and assistance that many of them have offered has been really helpful, and they have also contributed to the development of our ideas. At the moment, our headquarters are located at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom. The creation of our peanut plants that are hypoallergenic is currently under way.
