In April 2013, researchers from NASA/JPL, Caltech, and Arecibo Observatory published the results of radar observations and an in-depth motion analysis of the potentially hazardous asteroid 99942 Apophis. The findings will influence how scientists measure, predict, and potentially modify the asteroid's motion. The study, led by Jon Giorgini, a senior analyst in JPL's Solar System Dynamics group and member of the radar team, was presented at the AAS/DPS conference in Orlando, Florida, in October 2007.

Initially, upon its discovery in 2004, Apophis was estimated to have a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029, but further measurements showed no impact risk at that time. However, there will be a historically close approach to Earth, estimated to be a 1-in-800-year event for an object of its size. The Arecibo planetary radar telescope observed the asteroid in 2005 and 2006, showing that Apophis appears to be smoother than most Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) at 13-cm scales.

The analysis of Apophis also gives insight into situations likely to be encountered with undiscovered NEAs, such as a close approach that is not dangerous but is still close enough to potentially affect nearby objects. Factors like the spin of the asteroid, its mass, and the way it reflects and absorbs sunlight were taken into account in the study, all of which can influence its trajectory predictions. The team found that solar energy can cause modest position changes over the following 22 years leading up to a close encounter. However, these positional variations grow significantly only after passing through Earth's gravity field during the historically close approach in 2029.

While the study did not compute new impact probabilities, it revealed how the Standard Dynamical Model could over or underestimate impact probability for objects having close planetary encounters before the potential impact. The ability to predict changes and potential threats posed by undiscovered NEAs is vital for the safety of our planet.
