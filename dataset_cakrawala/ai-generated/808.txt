 Jonathan Schwennessen In 2006, Jonathan Schwennessen had the opportunity to start informal studies at the age of 17. He apprenticed for four years at the Heritage School of Woodworking, where he learned the basic skills needed to create custom and speculative  furniture. He then worked at Homestead Heritage Furniture, where he gained additional experience and knowledge by creating custom furniture for a variety of clients and designing Windsor chairs, Federal style cabinets, clocks, work tables, sleigh beds and even a waterwheel! It was around this time that he began to show an interest in teaching. Jonathan became an assistant teacher in 2009. He quickly began to acquire knowledge and skills to conduct some classes himself. Now he spends most of his time at carpentry school. “My hope is to teach others to work with their hands, which is an important aspect of life.” ×
