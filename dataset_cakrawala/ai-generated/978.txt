Photographed by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images for TechCrunch On Tuesday night, the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase began allowing users to trade bitcoin cash, a supposedly more scalable fork of bitcoin. Shortly after trading began, the price of bitcoin cash skyrocketed to $8,500, more than doubling from Monday's price. The price displayed by Coinbase was also nearly three times that of other exchanges. The erratic increase, even by cryptocurrency standards, caused jaws to drop on Twitter and, as reported by The Verge, led some to allege that something was amiss. Bitcoin cash was added to coinbase and increased by nearly 300 percent in a single day. Nearly $6500 in a single day. Why can't litecoin achieve this? Austin (@AZGraybill12) December 20, 2017 So is really going to tell everyone that the price per coin is over $8,500 when all the other exchanges say it's between $3,200 and $3,800? I smell a scam lol Engineer NearEngine (@Spyda 63) is on Twitter.

December 20, 2017 Advertisement According to TechCrunch, there was a suspicion that Coinbase employees or others who were aware of the impending change may have purchased Bitcoin Cash on other exchanges prior to the company's public announcement of its addition to the platform. The fact that the price of the cryptocurrency rose in the hours preceding the announcement may indicate that individuals were trading based on inside information. Legally, it would not be considered insider trading because cryptocurrencies are not securities, but if true, the allegations would cast doubt on the company's credibility. Four hours into Bitcoin Cash's whirlwind debut on the platform, Coinbase temporarily halted transactions for the cryptocurrency until around noon, resulting in further Twitter outrage. Why is Bitcoin Cash no longer on Coinbase? What the heck, mOE (@m0E tv)? December 20, 2017 removed the graphs of 8,500 Bitcoin Cash as if nothing had occurred. Seriously? My Twitter handle is @Am Steve Oh. December 20, 2017 On Wednesday, CEO Brian Armstrong announced on Medium that the allegations would be investigated. The company had apparently banned employees and their family and friends from trading in Bitcoin Cash more than a month before the launch. Armstrong wrote, "If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policiesdirectly or indirectlyI will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action."
