"Shadowverse" has revealed new information regarding three upcoming cards.

Cygames, the developer and operator of the competitive Collectible Card Game (CCG) "Shadowverse," has unveiled three new cards from the game's fourth card pack, "Storm of the Gods," in anticipation of its upcoming update. 

"Shadowverse," a mobile game that utilizes the "Bahamut: Battle of Legends" Intellectual Property (IP), introduced a Korean-language version on February 7th. Users can create decks with cards that have special effects and enjoy being part of global ranking battles.

With over 600 cards available today, the new card pack "Storm of the Gods" has a total of 104 cards. Through Game Chosun, let's delve into the first three new cards being revealed.

â—† 6 Stats for a cost of 4? "Balanced Owl"

The first card to be introduced is the neutral follower card "Balanced Owl," which has a cost of 4.

This Silver Rare-grade card grants itself a +2/+2 when entering play if the player's deck contains 20 or more neutral cards. 

The base parameters for this card are an attack power of 3 and health of 3, which is not very good considering the cost. Typically, cards with a cost of 4 have combinations of 3/4 or 4/3, totaling 7 in stats, along with special abilities.

When its special effect is activated, however, the 5/5 stats do carry a significant merit. Having a total of 10 stats usually only emerges from cards with a cost of 6 or higher. The only other follower with a cost of 4 and stats of 5/5 or more is the exclusive Dragon-class card "Leviathan(6/5)." The problem is that it cannot attack unless the player has 7 or more Play Points (PP), which limits its usefulness in the early game.

Nevertheless, it seems there is no proper place for the "Balanced Owl" card in the current metagame, which mainly uses job-specific cards. It's difficult to achieve the conditions for using the card unless it's drawn early on, as the number of neutral cards is often limited.

Instead, new strategies might be formed around having a certain number of neutral cards in the deck to maximize the potential of this card. As a whole, the "Balanced Owl" card adds a new layer of excitement in future "Shadowverse" battles with its unique abilities and dynamics.
