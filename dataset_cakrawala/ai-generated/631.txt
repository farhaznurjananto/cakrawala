This week marks the final push for the playoffs in Miami, and the Heat's chances could be influenced by several factors. Firstly, will Dion Waiters return from his sprained ankle, which has caused him to miss 11 games? Secondly, will LeBron James need to rest after playing 47 minutes in Sunday's overtime loss at Atlanta? And finally, will the Wizards rest their star players on Wednesday since they are locked into the No. 4 seed?

The final week of the regular season is sure to be exciting, particularly if it extends beyond Wednesday. Here are three key factors to watch:

1. End of the long wait: Dion Waiters, who has missed the last 11 games due to a sprained left ankle, has been upgraded from "out" to "questionable" on the Heat's injury report. Coach Erik Spoelstra confirmed that the swelling in Waiters' ankle has subsided and that he is out of his walking boot. Waiters' possible return tonight would provide a significant boost in the final two games and, if Miami qualifies, the playoffs.

2. Does LeBron need a night off? The Cleveland Cavaliers travel to South Florida for tonight's game following a disappointing overtime loss in Atlanta. The big question is whether LeBron James, who logged 47 minutes on Sunday, will play. Coach Tyronn Lue has not hesitated to rest key players if they need a break, regardless of Cleveland's position in the standings. James has prioritized being healthy and rested for the playoffs over securing the No. 1 seed. Currently, the Cavs are tied with the Celtics for first place in the Eastern Conference, with Cleveland holding the tie-breaker advantage.

3. Wizards prioritize playoff preparation: Locked into the No. 4 seed in the conference, the Washington Wizards will likely rest star guards John Wall and Bradley Beal in preparation for the playoffs. This could mean either sitting out or limiting their playtime in Wednesday's regular-season finale in Miami. However, this may not affect Miami's performance, as the Heat have already achieved a 3-0 record against the Wizards this season, including a recent 106-103 victory in Washington.
