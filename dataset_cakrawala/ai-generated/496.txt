A Massachusetts-based start-up called Gen9, which has close ties to the authors of a secretive human genome project, stands to benefit significantly from the plan to construct a human genome from scratch. At present, the cost to create a human genome amounts to $90 million. However, Gen9 aims to change that by collaborating with Autodesk, a CAD-software company. The ultimate goal is to develop human application design software that enables users to select design features to be written into bacterial cells. This innovative approach could revolutionize the way we create human genomes and propel Gen9 to the forefront of the biotechnology industry.
