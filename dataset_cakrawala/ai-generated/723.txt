Neurobehavioral follow-up  of a 5.5-year-old boy who underwent hemispherectomy for seizures showed that he  developed excellent verbal and intellectual abilities. These results are in contrast to recent reports suggesting that  nervous system plasticity may be overestimated, suggesting that left hemisphere and non-hemisphere resection after right hemisphere resection in perinatal lateral brain lesions may be overestimated. It is inconsistent with reports of developmental deficits in post-language function. After removing the left hemisphere, which contains the "classical language zone," the right hemisphere and other intact remaining structures can provide the necessary foundation for the development of superior adult language and intellectual abilities.
