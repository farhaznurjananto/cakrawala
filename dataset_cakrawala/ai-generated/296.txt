Enfield, like many other London boroughs, used to be a place where getting around on a bike seemed impossible. The area did not have the provisions for cycling infrastructure or the culture of cycling, with just 0.7% of journeys being made on bikes. Trying to cycle to work or school in Enfield was once considered a daunting task, especially when compared to cycling facilities found in Europe, where cycling was treated as a legitimate form of transport, meaning children could ride to school, and parents could ride to work safely.

However, the situation is now changing as the area has become part of a ground-breaking, multi-million-pound initiative to improve safety and facilities for cyclists. The initiative aims to make the area a “Mini Holland.” Enfield has won a £27m bid from the Mayor of London to make cycling a viable mode of transport. Enfield will have semi-segregated cycle lanes along five major routes, including the town centres of Edmonton and Enfield. The proposed designs for the new lanes score around 70% on cycling level of service (CLoS) rankings. The proposed improvements in Enfield are not close to the Netherlands’ impressive scores of 80-90%, but it is a big jump from 0%.

The need for better cycling infrastructure is underlined by a range of reports on air pollution. According to statistics, London’s emissions are responsible for almost 9,500 premature deaths a year, adding to the well-established health risks associated with a lack of physical activity. Children living in polluted areas are particularly affected; with evidence linking the levels of pollution in the air children breathe to the development of their lungs.

Opposition to cycling measures, such as the creation of cycle lanes, often comes from car drivers. The argument is frequently made that cycle lanes will increase congestion, driving times, and be bad for the economy. Unfortunately, many politicians succumb to this argument instead of seeing the economic benefits, especially to retail businesses, of creating better cycling and pedestrian facilities.

The need for infrastructure has resulted in a growing movement to create a cycling culture in Enfield. Playing Streets is an example, with the initiative closing residential roads to cars several times a year, so children can play safely, and for free. The project started in Bristol, and since its inception, communities across the UK have adopted various incarnations. An example is our Palmers Green rat-run, which was transformed into an official London Play Street two years ago. Each month, traffic is blocked off for three hours, allowing children to play with bikes, scooters, balls, and chalk.

While the Play Street initiative was a success, the story of its implementation was not without challenges. Some neighbours started a petition against it, arguing "roads were for cars, not kids," and "play streets would attract paedophiles". Fortunately, these neighbours came around, either approving the renewed Play Street order or taking part as stewards. The problem was they needed to see it worked. The same could be said about the proposed cycling infrastructure improvements.

Another significant force driving the movement is Sally, a dedicated cycle campaigner. According to Sally, she had a ‘missionary zeal’ when she began drip-feeding her sister online glimpses of cities where cycling was a viable form of transport, even for children. However, it was reading David Hembrow’s A View from the Cycle Path blog that had a significant impact. Hembrow offered compelling evidence from a study linking children's happiness to their ability to travel independently. In Europe, this means riding their bike to school or friends’ houses. Sally was frustrated about using the car to take her girls, who were just 1.5 miles from their school in Southgate. 

The challenge of cycling to school arose not because Enfield was not trying, but because it did not have the infrastructure that allowed cycling. While there was goodwill, there was nowhere to safely exercise it. Sally tried riding with her girls once a week, but safety issues compelled them to use the pavement, bumping up and down the kerbs of every side road and swerving around pedestrians. The possible dangers involved meant her younger daughter couldn’t cope with cycling, and her older daughter hated her for it. The family gave up. Meanwhile, millions of children in Denmark and the Netherlands cycled to school and friends’ houses on beautiful wide cycle paths that were completely separated from motor traffic.

However, the advent of new cycling facilities in the form of the Mini Holland initiative rekindled the hope that children would ride to school independently. Enfield now has the opportunity to join other European cities in redefining cycling infrastructure. The borough won the grant in recognition of its low cycling rates, high levels of pollution, and obesity. Enfield’s primary school children have one of the highest levels of childhood obesity in the UK. So, the proposed cycling infrastructure is not just about saving the planet; it's about saving people from chronic illnesses.

However, not everyone in Enfield is as enthusiastic about the new cycling measures. Bright yellow posters have appeared in shop windows across the area, with a message that cycle lanes would “kill” shops, create congestion and pollution, and be a menace to the elderly and disabled. Public meetings, held by local politicians and representatives like Tory MP David Burrowes, offer dissenters political space to air their views. Despite this, a recent consultation showed that 60% of respondents supported the plans. The majority is clearly willing to embrace a new vision of Enfield.

However, there is still work to be done to make Mini Holland a reality in Enfield. A battle lies ahead to convince the remaining residents that this is the way to create a safer, healthier, and more sustainable borough for future generations. With a supportive community and politicians looking out for the best interests of everyone, there is hope for cycling in Enfield. While new cycling facilities may make Enfield feel like a different place, the benefits of such infrastructure go well beyond cycling to become an agent of social and economic transformation.
