A member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee's staff said that the committee has been getting "dozens and dozens" of calls from current and former employees and customers who say that equipment, mostly from Huawei, is acting in a suspicious way. "I don't think the companies should expect us to stop paying attention to them," a staff member said, adding that the panel would follow up on new leads. In a report released Monday after an 11-month investigation, the House committee warned US businesses that Beijing could use equipment made by two US companies to spy on certain communications and threaten vital systems through computer links. It told network providers they should look for other suppliers. The report also said that any future business deals between Huawei or ZTE and US companies should be stopped. Huawei, which is the second-biggest maker of routers and other telecom equipment in the world, and ZTE, which is the fifth-biggest, both denied the claims. The Commerce Ministry of China said that the US committee "made false accusations against China." Canada said on Tuesday that it would not let Huawei build a secure communications network for the Canadian government, citing possible security risks. This is just one more problem for Huawei. Australia stopped Huawei from trying to get contracts for the country's National Broadband Network in March because of fears about cyber security. The European Commission, on the other hand, has put off a trade case against two Chinese companies that make telecom equipment. This has made things easier between the European Union and China, which is its second-biggest trading partner. The 52-page report from the US panel didn't show any proof that the companies' equipment had been used for spying, but it did say that a classified annex had "significantly more information" that made the committee even more worried. Former and current US intelligence officials said that Huawei and ZTE, which are both based in Shenzhen in southern China, could be a threat to national security. However, there didn't seem to be a consensus on whether their equipment had been used to break security. One former US official said that there were "smoking guns" that showed that Huawei was a threat, and that the defense industry was the main target. Another former senior US intelligence official said that the threat of illegal eavesdropping may be more theoretical than real. Mike Rogers, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, talked about "beaconing" information to China on Monday, but he didn't name any specific users of Huawei's equipment who had been harmed. In Britain, the Chinese company's equipment is used to build 4G mobile broadband networks and is at the heart of BT's national phone network.
