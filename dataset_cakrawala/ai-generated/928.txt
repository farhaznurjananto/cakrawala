When we first launched this site, our view of Porsche was a little short-sighted. We  all revolved around the air-cooled Porsche, with a more limited focus on just the 993. These three years with PorschePurist (yes, we've been all along) have deepened our love for all types of Porsche. Not only did he add a Cayenne to his garage, but he's become a Cayman and Boxster fan, wants a 914, and owns his new 911 GT2 RS. 
  Given that our attitudes have changed, we thought it was time to reach out and examine your feelings. We are not only  interested in your thoughts,  your answers will help  shape our future content and offers.As the title of this post suggests, "Your favorite Porsche and its What's the reason?"
