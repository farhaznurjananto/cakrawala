– They are very motivated and want to do well, we have a very good dynamic. It is our first step towards a future goal and we have to take it one game at a time. We are not looking past the match against LDLC, says Roger Sahlström.

He has a good feeling in the group, but at the same time he knows that it’s only the beginning.

– The group is very happy, we have wonderful equipment, our coach is working a lot and we have a good dynamic. But we have to work hard to continue down this path.
