On Wednesday, a series of horrific attacks in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, targeted Shiites and claimed the lives of over 90 people. The Sunni extremist group, ISIS, took responsibility for the bombings.

The first attack occurred when a car bomb detonated at a crowded market in Baghdad. The bombing claimed at least 64 lives and left 87 others wounded in the largely Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City. The attack left a chaotic scene with hundreds of people gathering at the site of the explosion. The aftermath showcased blood-stained streets, blown-out car windows and a charred sidewalk.

Later in the day, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest detonated in a busy square in the Shiite neighborhood of al-Kadhimiya. This attack took 17 lives and injured 43 others, as reported by two Baghdad police officials. A third attack targeted a checkpoint manned by Shiites in the Sunni neighborhood of al-Jamia in western Baghdad. A suicide car bomber triggered the blast which claimed 12 lives and left 31 others injured.

The attacks have shaken Baghdad and the rest of Iraq. Such brazen and brutal attacks have become more frequent since Iraqi forces, backed by the US-led coalition, retook the city of Mosul from ISIS. The country is already dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakened economy, and simmering political divisions. The attacks add to the woes of the Iraqi people.

The Iraqi Prime Minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, condemned the attacks and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. The UN also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and urged the government to ensure the protection of civilians.

Meanwhile, ISIS has continued to pose a significant threat despite losing the territories that once formed its so-called caliphate. The group remains a formidable force that is capable of causing large-scale damage and destruction. The recent bombings remind us of the urgent need to tackle the root causes of terrorism and extremism, and to work towards fostering peace, stability and tolerance in the region.
