Leaders from over 20 federally-recognized tribes gathered in Cherokee this week to attend the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET) Sovereignty Protection Fund Annual Meeting. Held at Harrah's Cherokee Casino Event Center, the meeting was hosted by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

The leaders discussed a range of important issues impacting Indian Country, emphasizing the need to work collaboratively for a brighter future for Indigenous communities. The annual meeting provided a platform for tribal representatives to share ideas and experiences while striving to address the various challenges faced by their communities.

A significant addition to the USET organization was the Pamunkey Indian Tribe of Virginia, which received its federal recognition last year. The tribe and its leader, Chief Robert Gray, were welcomed into the organization, and they expressed their eagerness to work together with USET in promoting the tribe's well-being.

The event also paid tribute to the late Howard E. Tommie, former Chairman of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Tommie was remembered for his dedication to self-determination and his extensive work with Indigenous tribes. His contributions and efforts in advocating for Indian communities were lauded by attendees, recognizing his passion for serving both his tribe and the people.

By bringing together tribal leaders from around the country, the USET Sovereignty Protection Fund Annual Meeting fostered dialogue and collaboration among Indian tribes, ultimately seeking a better future for Indigenous populations throughout the United States.
