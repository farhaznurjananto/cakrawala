Texas's Fort Bend County - According to the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office, one person was killed after a shooting in the parking lot of the Shops at Bella Terra shopping center in the Richmond area. Friday at 7:30 p.m., a shooting occurred near the Sushi Hana restaurant in the center of the 99 Grand Parkway, south of the Westpark Tollway. The victim, a man in his 20s, was shot, according to deputies. He then drove to the center's Buffalo Wild Wings, went inside, told people he had been hit, and collapsed. According to deputies, he died after he was transported to Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital. Sheriff Troy Nehls believes the shooting was the result of a drug transaction after discovering a firearm and drugs in the victim's vehicle. "The vehicle contains a substantial amount of illegal substances. The presence of a handgun in the vehicle leads me to believe that a failed drug transaction may have occurred. But when you add firearms and drugs to the mix, you're playing with fire "Nehls said. According to deputies, there were more than a dozen shell casings in the parking lot. At Sushi Hana, witnesses reported hearing at least ten gunshots. "We were just sitting at the table when we heard what sounded like black cats (firecrackers). We weren't sure what was happening, but then the restaurant went silent "Nicole TooToo testified, It appeared that some bullets struck the tires of vehicles, but no one else was hurt. The shooter continues to evade capture. Deputies reported that the shopping center is secure and safe. According to the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office, the victim of a shooting has died.
