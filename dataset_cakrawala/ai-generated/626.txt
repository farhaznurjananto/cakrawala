Retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate, Ben Carson, officially endorsed Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, during a press conference in Miami on Friday. Carson, who exited the presidential race last week, had nothing but praise for the GOP frontrunner, pointing out what he sees as Trump's intelligence, commitment, and deep concern about the future of America.

In an effort to promote unity within the deeply divided Republican party, Carson publicly backed the current leader in the race, saying, "Donald Trump talks a lot about making America great, but it's not just talk. Heâ€™s actually a very intelligent person." He also mentioned that the Trump the public sees is not always the person he is in private, stating that Trump is "much more cerebral than that and a much more reasonable person than comes across."

Carson acknowledged that he and Trump have had their differences throughout the campaign trail; however, he was quick to assure the audience that they had "buried the hatchet" over former disputes. Stressing the need for a unified Republican party to better represent the voice of the people, Carson expressed his desire to stand behind the candidate who had the support of the majority of GOP voters thus far.

Not oblivious to the potential surprise factor of his endorsement, Carson explained, "We move on because it's not about me, it's not about Mr. Trump, it's about America. There is a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was."

Carson is the second former presidential hopeful to endorse Trump, following New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who threw his support behind the Republican frontrunner in February in Texas. Although Carson's own campaign failed to gain significant traction, his endorsement may prove beneficial for Trump by bolstering his bid for the GOP nomination, particularly among religious conservatives who have been drawn to Carson's personal beliefs and background.

At present, Trump maintains a significant lead in delegates for the GOP primary. Upcoming votes in winner-take-all states, such as Ohio and Florida, will be crucial for other contenders in the race, potentially making or breaking their chances of nomination. Carson officially dropped out of the race on March 4 at the Conservative Political Action Conference, after his campaign announced that they saw no viable "political path forward."
