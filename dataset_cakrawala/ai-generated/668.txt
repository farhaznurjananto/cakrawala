A 68-year-old man from Chehalis has sought legal counsel after discovering that his dog suffered a broken jaw during its stay at the city animal shelter. Bruce Beauregard, the owner of the 6-year-old Dachshund-mix named Rowdy, was upset and enraged by the incident.

Rowdy's stay at the animal shelter was the result of Beauregard's arrest for drunk driving. The dog was reported to be aggressive when police officers attempted to remove it from Beauregard's truck. Chehalis Police Department Officer Bruce Thompson stated in a written report that the Dachshund lunged at him, prompting Thompson to offer his shoe as a barrier. However, the city denies that the animal was kicked.

Upon retrieving Rowdy from the shelter, Beauregard noticed his dog's head hanging down and his face smashed up. A visit to the veterinarian confirmed that Rowdy had a completely fractured jaw on both sides, an unusual injury that the veterinarian had not seen in his 30 years of practice. Rowdy was euthanized the same day.

Beauregard, who now has a lawyer, hopes to seek legal action against the officer involved in the incident. He feels that the event was cruel, unwarranted, and inhumane, comparing it to what would happen if he were to harm his neighbor's dog. The absence of his canine companion has left Beauregard feeling heartbroken, as he spends more time away from home and misses Rowdy while fishing with friends and their dogs.
