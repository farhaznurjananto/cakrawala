In NEW DELHI: Shah Rukh Khan's comparison to Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed was sharply condemned by the BJP on Wednesday, calling the remarks "uncalled for" and unrepresentative of the party's or Prime Minister Narendra Modi's core values. The BJP heaped accolades on the Bollywood singer, who was also blasted by top party figure Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday, and claimed there could be no comparison between an Indian person who follows the law and a Pakistani terrorist. In particular, Khan, an immensely popular and well-respected Indian national and musician, cannot be compared to a terrorist like Hafiz Saeed, according to BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli. Adityanath's remarks are unjustified and inaccurate. These in no way represent the fundamental beliefs of the BJP or those of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed. In order to demonstrate that the party did not agree with Vijarvargiya's remarks, BJP leaders were put on the defense just after party chairman Amit Shah had cautioned some party leaders against making provocative statements in the wake of the Dadri lynching and beef controversy. Khan was accused by Vijarvargiya on Tuesday of mimicking the voices of anti-national groups, saying that while he may reside in India, his spirit actually belonged to Pakistan. On Wednesday, he took his tweets down. Srikant Sharma, the secretary of the BJP, claimed that the Congress was "sponsoring" the writers', artists', and scientists' campaign against the "climate of intolerance." He claimed that the Congress was using these strategies to overcome its internal leadership crisis and that it still had not accepted Modi's leadership. "The nation is at peace, but Congress leaders are uneasy about Rahul Gandhi's leadership. As a result, its leadership has turned to these strategies. It is its antipathy for Modi's leadership because it cannot accept the fact that India is succeeding on all fronts. Therefore it is funding these demonstrations led by so-called writers, many of whom had campaigned for the loss of Modi in the Lok Sabha polls, the man stated.
