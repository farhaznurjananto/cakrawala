A group of ultra-Orthodox rabbis is trying to invalidate the religious divorces of women who have divorced in secular courts and followed the financial and custody arrangements made by secular judges. The ruling would also affect women who have obtained their divorce through the pressure of groups like the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot or through Israel's state rabbinical courts because those courts can threaten to imprison those who refuse to issue the “get,” or religious divorce paper. The wording of the ruling could be interpreted to prevent women from turning to the police if they are victims of domestic violence. 

Rabbi Dovid Eidensohn and his brother, Rabbi Daniel Eidensohn, are among the supporters of this ruling. Daniel Eidensohn runs the Da'at Torah blog, where the ruling was published. Even though he claims to be an anti-child sexual abuse advocate, he mostly serves as a mouthpiece for Rabbi Moshe Shternbach from Eidah Charedis. Meanwhile, Dovid Eidensohn is not intelligent or honest enough to understand that many rabbis who were contemporaries of the Rashba, a prominent religious authority, disagreed with him. Halakha, the collective body of Jewish laws, has never followed the strict interpretation of the Rashba's view until recently. This changed when ultra-Orthodox leaders like the heads of Eidah Charedis and the recently deceased Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv emerged. 

The ruling by these rabbis would create tens of thousands of “mamzerim gemurim,” children born out of wedlock, overnight and invalidates "95%" of gets issued globally. Dovid Eidensohn does not seem to care that such a ruling could cause irreparable harm and shame to affected individuals and their offspring for generations to come. He cherry-picks the stringent rulings of dead rabbis to support his beliefs without considering the moderate or lenient rulings. 

In summary, if the ruling is accepted, it would cause significant harm to those affected and ignores centuries of halakhic interpretation.
