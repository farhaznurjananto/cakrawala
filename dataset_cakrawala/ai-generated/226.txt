New York City has implemented an ordinance that limits the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces in volume as part of an effort to combat the obesity epidemic. However, it appears that coffee giant Starbucks does not plan to change its offerings when the ban goes into effect on 12 March. 

A spokesperson for the company indicated that they believe their drinks are not subject to the regulations as many of the company’s signature drinks are milk-based, and most offer high levels of customisation. Starbucks believes that if a customer can customise the drink by adding sugar, for example, then it would fall outside the ban. The regulations also state that coffee and tea based drinks are only covered if they contain less than 50% milk or milk substitutes.

A 20-ounce venti Starbucks drink is larger than the drinks allowed by the ban, but the company’s interpretation of the new rule is that the customer can choose to modify the drink by adding sugar or not, which would fall outside the ban. Additionally, the company notes that many of its beverages contain milk, a food item that is exempted from the ban.

The proposal to ban oversized, sugary drinks has already drawn protests from food service establishments and trade groups such as The American Beverage Association. In October, these organisations filed a lawsuit alleging that New York’s Board of Health by-passed proper legislative processes and overstepped its bounds when it proposed the rule. Starbucks is not part of the lawsuit, but the company is watching carefully as it plans a response.

While the ban prohibits food service establishments from selling non-alcoholic drinks larger than 16 ounces that contain caloric sweeteners, it does not apply to diet drinks, 100% fruit juices or items that are at least half milk, ice cream, or milk substitute. In a statement, the city's health department said the regulations would have no impact on 20-ounce cups of coffee unless more than four sugar packets are added, and noted that coffee drinkers can add as much sugar as they please.

Starbucks has not announced any immediate plans to change its menu offerings, noting that it is taking advantage of the three-month grace period before the city starts fining non-compliant companies for breaking the rules. A spokesperson said the one item on Starbucks’ menu that they are looking at during this period is the Frappuccino, which contains a large quantity of milk and ice.

In conclusion, based on its interpretation of the regulations, Starbucks does not envisage any of its drinks being affected by the ban introduced by the New York City authorities. However, the chain is observing the new rules and is watching carefully to determine whether it may need to make any dispositions in relation to the requirements. If necessary, the coffee giant will adapt its menu appropriately to comply with the regulations.
