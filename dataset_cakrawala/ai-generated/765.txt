education 
 
 Education is critical to social mobility and the future well-being of our country and its people. All children deserve the opportunity to receive an excellent education, regardless of where they live or  their parents' income. Choice, competition and educational innovations that give parents the freedom to decide what is best for their children open up more opportunities for all children, especially  those who most  need  a brighter future.
