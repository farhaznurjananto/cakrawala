Don't worry, I'm not going to be one of those people who falls off the map completely and then comes back to say "oh sorry I missed the whole game" 
I'm interested to see what everyone has to say about the setup, I've never played before.

I have a lot of ideas for games, though I have yet to see them come to fruition. I've never played a game of mafia, but I am very interested in playing.

I want to see what kind of game you want to run, you seem to have a good handle on the game. https://twitter.com/#!/TorteDeLini (@TorteDeLini)

I'm glad to hear that. Mafia is a really fun game. I'm glad to hear that. Mafia is a really fun game. https://twitter.com/#!/TorteDeLini (@TorteDeLini)

I'll post the game we play once we get started. It's a 6 player game, with 3 mafia and 3 town. The townspeople can only know one other person in the game, and the mafia can know 2 other people. The mafia must choose one person to lynch each day, and the townspeople can only vote for someone they know is not the mafia. The mafia can also put people on trial, and the townspeople can vote to convict or acquit. Here's the link to the game:
