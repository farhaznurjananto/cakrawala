Redstockings Manifesto I: The Unity of Women in the Face of Male Supremacy

Redstockings, a feminist organization, is dedicated to unifying women and achieving their freedom from male supremacy. For centuries, women have struggled independently and politically to gain liberation. Now, it is time to join forces and create a movement.

Women are an oppressed class. Their oppression is all-encompassing and touches every aspect of their lives. They have been exploited as sex objects, breeders, domestic servants, and cheap labor. Society considers them as inferior beings, whose only purpose is to enhance men's lives. Women's humanity is denied, and the prescribed behavior is enforced by the threat of physical violence. Due to living so intimately with their oppressors and in isolation from each other, they have not viewed their personal suffering as a political condition. This has led to the illusion that a woman's relationship with her partner is an individual problem that can be resolved through personal effort. However, the reality is that every such relationship is a class relationship, and the conflicts between individual men and women are political conflicts that can only be solved collectively.

The agents of women's oppression are identified as men. Male supremacy is the oldest, most basic form of domination. All other forms of exploitation and oppression, like racism, capitalism, and imperialism, are extensions of male supremacy. Men dominate women, and a few men dominate the rest. Throughout history, all power structures have been male-dominated and male-oriented. Men have controlled all political, economic, and cultural institutions and backed up this control with physical force. They have used their power to keep women in an inferior position. All men receive economic, sexual, and psychological benefits from male supremacy, which is why all men have oppressed women.

Many have tried to shift the responsibility of women's oppression from men to institutions or women themselves. However, this is evasive. Institutions alone are not responsible for oppression. They are merely tools of the oppressor. To blame institutions implies that men and women are victimized equally. It obscures the fact that men benefit from the subordination of women and gives men the excuse that they are forced to be oppressors. Women's submission is not the result of brainwashing, stupidity, or mental illness; instead, it is the product of continual, daily pressure from men. Rather than change themselves, we need to change men. The most slanderous evasion of all is that women can oppress men. The illusion is supported by the isolation of individual relationships from their political context, and the tendency of men to view any legitimate challenge to their privileges as persecution.

Redstockings' task is to develop female class consciousness through sharing experiences and exposing the sexist foundation of all institutions. The organization cannot rely on existing ideologies since they are all products of male supremacist culture. They question every generalization unless they are confirmed by their experiences. Consciousness-raising is not therapy since it assumes that the male-female relationship is purely personal and suggests the existence of individual solutions. This can only be achieved through honesty, in private and public life, with oneself and other women.

Redstockings identify with all women, defining their best interest as that of the poorest, most brutally exploited woman. They repudiate all economic, racial, educational, and status privileges that divide them from other women. They are committed to achieving internal democracy and ensuring that every woman in the movement has an equal chance to participate, assume responsibility, and develop her political potential.

The organization calls on all women to unite in struggle and asks all men to give up their male privilege and support women's liberation in the interest of our humanity and their own. Redstockings fights for women's liberation and always takes the side of women against their oppressors. They do not consider what is "revolutionary" or "reformist"; only what is good for women. After individual skirmishes that yielded little success, Redstockings is going all the way. 

On July 7,1969, Redstockings published this manifesto. They invited women to join them in their fight for liberation. Their address was P.O. Box 748 Stuyvesant Station, New York, N.Y. 10009.
