Across Chicagoland, numerous clinics that specialize in sports medicine, hair replacement and plastic surgery are now offering stem cell treatments for illnesses ranging from Parkinson’s Disease, to ALS and Multiple Sclerosis. These treatments offer a ray of hope for people who are suffering from the aforementioned illnesses. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised concerns about the possible harm that these treatments can cause - they have suggested that they currently lack any empirical basis showing their effectiveness which means they might be unsafe. 

Bioethicist at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Leigh Turner has identified more than 351 businesses nationwide that offer stem cell treatments. He, however, remains skeptical of these treatments because many of the clinics don't have meaningful credentials when it comes to stem cell research. He added that they often make claims that aren't currently supported by established medical evidence. The facilities claim that they can cure a wide range of maladies such as hair loss, orthopedics, autism, dementia, and heart disease among others. A few of such clinics operate in the Chicagoland area and offer a variety of treatments. 

Dr. Daniel Ritacca, a reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon who is based in Vernon Hills, affirms that he has treated many COPD patients, and he hasn’t had any complaints in their treatment. He has also offered stem cell treatments to many patients with Parkinson’s Disease, MS, asthma and stroke. He insists that he's seen heart patients and others suffering from multiple sclerosis experience dramatic results. Patients come to his clinic hoping that these treatments will improve their overall health and had high hopes for a positive outcome. He argues that if it is possible to help these struggling patients inexpensively, why not try it? 

Dr. Turner states, however, that the FDA isn't doing enough to monitor what he calls "stem cell snake oil." He has identified three cases, including a Florida cardiologist who lost his license after two patients passed away in his care. In another case, a woman sued a Florida clinic after a stem cell treatment intended to stop her macular degeneration, left her legally blind - the clinic’s chief scientific officer was, in fact, a YMCA aerobics instructor. In addition, unproven stem cell therapies carry very real risks, which may create new short-and-long-term health problems or make patients’ conditions or symptoms more difficult to manage.

The Skokie-based International Society for Stem Cell Research warns that many of these clinics offering stem cell treatment make claims about the effectiveness of their treatment that are not supported by a current understanding of science. The society, which represents thousands of stem cell researchers in almost 60 countries, adds that unproven stem cell treatments come with substantial risks. Patients' out-of-pocket expenses could be enormous, and complications may lead to serious health problems.

So far, Dr. Ritacca’s therapies have had positive results; however as he admits, he lacks FDA approval. He says that he is transparent about this when speaking to his patients. He believes that the FDA is on the verge of expanding approval of stem cell therapies and he's optimistic that he'll soon be able to report his results through proper channels. 

Despite negative sentiment from the FDA and the International Society for Stem Cell Research, Dr. Ritacca stands by his treatments, offering the best solutions that he can to his patients. He points out that he is still seeing a good response from people and strongly believes that his stem cell treatment will revolutionize medicine. As long as an opportunity exists to help his patients ethically, he is all-in.
