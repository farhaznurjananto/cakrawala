In the era of large hard disks, many users often find themselves struggling to copy large files from a DVD to their hard drive, even when there is ample free space available. The most common reason behind this issue is not related to copy protection but rather the size of the file exceeding the limit of the hard drive's file system.

Windows XP supports two different file system formats: FAT32 and NTFS. FAT32 can only handle files up to 4GB, which at the time of its development was an impressively large file size. Nowadays, DVDs frequently contain files exceeding 4GB, such as high-definition movies. Consequently, attempting to copy these large files to a FAT32-formatted hard drive is futile due to the file system's size limitation.

To tackle this problem, it is essential to convert the hard disk to the NTFS file system. The New Technology File System (NTFS) was first introduced in the mid-1990s via Windows NT and is available in all subsequent Windows versions. NTFS offers a vast range of improvements over FAT-based file systems, such as advanced data structures, enhanced reliability, and increased disk space utilization. Plus, it supports both a hard disk and file size of 16 EiB (exbibyte), which is considerably larger than FAT32's maximum file size of 4GB.

Those intending to copy files larger than 4GB must first ensure that their destination hard disk's file system is formatted as NTFS and not FAT32. However, it is important to note that many portable USB hard disk drives are pre-formatted as FAT32 to provide maximum compatibility across various operating systems. Users can easily convert their file system using the "CONVERT" command in the Windows Command Prompt. This command does not erase the disk, so existing files should remain intact. Nonetheless, users are advised to maintain a backup of essential files as a safety precaution.
