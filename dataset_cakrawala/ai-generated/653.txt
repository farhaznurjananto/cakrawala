Rumors about Florida Governor Charlie Crist's alleged visits to the Green Iguana, a bar in Tampa, during the early 1990s have persisted for years. Rick Calderoni, the gay owner of the bar, has stated that Crist was a regular customer and that the two became friends. When asked if he believed Crist to be gay, Calderoni answered affirmatively, although he also admitted that he had never witnessed Crist being intimate with another man. Despite the continued speculation, no definitive proof has emerged to substantiate the rumors about Crist's sexual orientation.

These longstanding rumors may soon gain national attention, as Crist is considered a potential candidate for vice president under John McCain. If chosen, Crist would be part of a historic election, with voters considering candidates who could become the first black president, first female commander in chief, and first (albeit not openly) gay vice president.

Although most voters may claim they don't care about a candidate's sexuality, curiosity is a natural human tendency. However, unless a scandalous event occurs, it is unlikely that the issue would significantly impact the election. In fact, the presence of a sexually diverse candidate may add intrigue and, potentially, support to the campaign. As evidenced by the election of Bill Clinton, who was known for his philandering ways, voters may not place much importance on a candidate's personal life in comparison to their political ideals.

The speculation surrounding Crist's alleged relationships with male GOP staffers did not prevent his landslide victory in the gubernatorial race in Florida. If Crist is selected as McCain's running mate, it remains to be seen how national press outlets will cover the rumors, and whether any concrete evidence will emerge to confirm or disprove the long-running whispers about Crist's sexuality.
