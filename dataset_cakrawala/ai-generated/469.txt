In eastern Texas, a dense forest serves as the location for an intense search operation. Hundreds of rescuers are trying to locate a missing three-year-old boy, Ezra Parrish. Despite being lost for nearly a day, hope remains alive as a search dog picks up on a scent nearby.

On May 27, 2017, Gloria Cooper and her husband, Jeremy, were enjoying a night out at a Dave & Buster's restaurant in Houston, Texas, while her son Ezra, from a previous relationship, was on a camping trip about 60 miles away. 

Ezra, along with his siblings, was taken to the Sam Houston National Forest by his biological father. This forest is approximately an hour's drive north of Houston and is a favorite destination for campers and hikers seeking a break from the city. Being one of only four National Forests in the entire state, it remains a popular choice for outdoor enthusiasts.
