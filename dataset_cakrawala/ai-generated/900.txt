44News spoke with a few high school students while waiting for the presidential candidate. Braylon Rose, Tristan Sharp, and Dillen Johnson, who attend Castle High School, told 44News that the rally is considered an excused absence. Our reporters were told that as long as they had their tickets and a signed note from their parents, their absence would be excused. Other Vanderburgh and Warrick County students were also present at Trump's rally. Comments are welcome.
