A large group of protestors gathered to confront Texas Governor Rick Perry as he arrived at Popovers on the Square on Thursday morning. The demonstrators made it clear that they do not support his plans to overhaul Social Security and Medicare.

"Hands off Medicare! Hands off Medicare!" chanted the protestors, members of the New Hampshire Alliance of Retired Americans, in unison. Some held signs declaring "No Texas trash talk," and "Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme."

When asked by a reporter about the protestors, Perry responded, "If they're all senior citizens then they have nothing to worry about."

Amidst a swarm of television cameras, journalists, and photographers, Perry greeted both citizens and Popovers' employees like Whitney Bresson, who offered the Texas governor a popover and some chilled water.

"That's amazing after the pancake I just had," Perry commented while a voter in the background shouted, "Let them eat cake, governor!"

Bresson and several colleagues relished their encounter with the Republican Presidential candidate. "He was very pleasant and had a firm handshake," she remarked.

Despite the protestors, Perry discovered a wealth of support for his Presidential aspirations, which he announced just last weekend in South Carolina, instantly influencing the Republican Presidential primary race.

Mike Esthers of Portsmouth, one of Perry's supporters, had his family take a photo with the governor. "There are plenty of people here who support Rick Perry and appreciate his policies," Esthers told one of the demonstrators before the governor arrived at Popovers.

Martha Fuller Clark, a former State Senator from Portsmouth and Democrat, questioned Perry about his stance on global warming, which the Texas governor has not entirely endorsed. "The verdict is still out," Perry informed her.

Fuller Clark expressed worry over Perry's refusal to consider the scientific research on global warming. "We could have a president who is unwilling to acknowledge scientific facts," she lamented. "All you have to do is look at what's happening in Greenland."

Perry spent less than an hour at Popovers before he and his team strolled down Congress Street, turned onto Fleet Street, and climbed into an SUV headed for their next destination in Dover.
