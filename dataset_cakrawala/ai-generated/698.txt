Cyclists Triumph in Unconventional Races

In today's cycling news, Belgian Jelle Vanendert emerged victorious in the 14th stage of the Tour de France, outpacing Spain's Samuel Sanchez by 21 seconds and finishing 46 seconds ahead of Andy Schleck from Luxembourg. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a group of cyclists managed to beat a JetBlue plane in a race from Burbank to Long Beach. 

With the closure of the 405 freeway, JetBlue's Flight 405 was meant to provide a solution for commuters trying to bypass the traffic chaos. However, the airline's initiative was outdone not only by a team of elite cyclists known as the @wolfpackhustle but also by @garyridesbikes, who took public transit and walked. If reports on Twitter are accurate, a Rollerblader, @jennix, finished in third place. The entire race can be followed on Twitter under the hashtag #flightvsbikes. 

Unofficial finishing times, according to @bcgp, are as follows:
- Bike: 1:34
- Metro/Walk: 1:44
- Rollerblades: 2:40
- Plane/Lost Cabdriver: 2:54 

JetBlue passengers, @ohaijoe and @ezrahorne, tweeted that their cab driver was unable to locate the lighthouse at Long Beach, which contributed to their delayed arrival. The @wolfpackhustle team had almost reached downtown L.A. by the time Team JetBlue arrived at Burbank's Bob Hope Airport. Despite the JetBlue executive's claims before the flight that the 22-minute flight time could be reduced to 14 minutes, it soon became clear that the cyclists would secure a decisive victory. 

The race demonstrated that cycling, often considered an impractical or irritating mode of transportation in the United States, could be the quickest, most cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and healthiest solution for commuters. Though the cyclists in this race were undoubtedly fit and adept at navigating L.A.'s traffic, the outcome establishes the potential of cycling for various types of trips, not just within cities but also to airports. 

U.S. cities typically have less-than-optimal infrastructure for cycling compared to their European counterparts, but the reasons people give for not cycling in America are often attributable to failures of imagination or preconceived notions. This event has now not only highlighted the effectiveness of cycling but also revealed Los Angeles' often-underestimated subway system and its potential for commuting around the city.

The unique transportation challenges posed by this race have broad implications for reevaluating modes of transport and reconsidering the practicality and efficiency of short-distance air travel. Spain, for example, has seen a marked decrease in air travel between Madrid and Barcelona due to the introduction of high-speed rail. By evaluating different transportation options and challenging conventional wisdom, this race promotes new thinking and encourages us to reconsider our approach to commuting.
