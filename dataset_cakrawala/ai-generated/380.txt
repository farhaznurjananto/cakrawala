Former NBA star Steve Kerr recently wrote an article in Grantland where he argued in favor of increasing the NBA's minimum age from 19 to 20. Kerr’s argument is that younger players should be forced to spend more time as scholar-athletes so that they can develop more fully, which ultimately would provide the league with better talent. However, Kerr's arguments are not supported by actual research and data. In fact, studies show that the younger a player enters the NBA, the more successful he's likely to become.

Let's take a closer look at Kerr's arguments and compare them to the research. Firstly, Kerr argues that the lack of college experience breeds "collective immaturity" and influences bad decision-making in the NBA, but this claim is unfounded. Research shows that the incidence rate of off-the-court issues is unrelated to when a player enters the NBA. Furthermore, NBA scouts and front offices have proven to be excellent evaluators of pro preparedness in regard to both on and off-court maturity.

Secondly, Kerr claims that having an extra season to assess college players would cut down on the personnel mistakes that teams inevitably make in the draft, something that could potentially save the league millions of dollars every year. However, research shows that draft mistakes are unrelated to the age at which a player enters the draft. The study concluded that NBA-caliber talent emerges at or around the age of 18, and NBA team executives have accurately selected talented players through the draft.

Thirdly, Kerr's argument regarding player development is flawed. He questions why NBA franchises should assume the responsibility and financial burden of player development when colleges happily assumed that role for them. However, research has shown that players who moved into the NBA directly from high school generally perform better than players with a single year of college experience. Moreover, arguing about postseason success for an individual player of a team game is not rational since the success of an NBA team is not solely determined by one player.

Fourthly, Kerr argues that raising the minimum age to 20 would be beneficial for marketing purposes as NBA fans would get to see college stars play for longer. However, studies show that the excitement around a player's draft does not necessarily equate to better team performances.

Lastly, Kerr talks about the sense of team and connection that he experienced with fellow Michigan State alumni Draymond Green, Mateen Cleaves, and Steve Smith. However, Kerr’s anecdote is irrelevant since he fails to show how it relates to his argument.

In conclusion, Kerr's claims that the NBA would be better off by raising the minimum age requirement for players is not supported by actual research and data. The current system has proven effective in producing talented and successful NBA players. Arguing for an age increase is not necessary and detracts from the real issues that need tackling in the NBA.
