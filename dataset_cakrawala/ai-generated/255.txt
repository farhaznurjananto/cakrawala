The Anglican Church in Uganda recently announced plans to construct a museum at the Uganda Martyrs Heritage Centre in Namugongo, a township in Central Uganda. The project, which will be run by the Chairman of the Project, the Archbishop Emeritus of Uganda, Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo, aims to develop the entire Martyrs Heritage Centre where the first seed of Christianity was sown in Uganda, possibly in East Africa, and the whole of Africa during the reign of King Mwanga Basammula 11.

The goal of the project is to provide “empirical information on the Uganda martyrs with the construction of a one-stop centre in which information can be obtained on issues related to the martyrs.” The proposed museum is expected to create a national and international tourist centre, honouring the brave men who were killed and depicting the rich religious and cultural values of Uganda.

The estimated cost of the project is approximately $14m. Due to the large amount of money required to complete the project, the construction will be carried out in justifiable phases so as not to exhaust willing contributors. According to Archbishop Emeritus Nkoyoyo, the project’s first phase will begin with the main killing area, including a big shelter estimated at approximately $800,000, that will house the command post of the Chief Executioner of the prison where the convicts were kept before they were killed. Additionally, the shelter will house the firewood spot where dry firewood was kept in readiness to burn the convicts and the tree to which the convicts were tied and dismembered.

The facility will also have a burning spot where the convicts were burnt to death and the Martyrs Memorial Church where the remains of the martyrs are kept. The second phase of the ambitious project will include the construction of a three-storey building to accommodate offices, religious and cultural artifacts, a resource centre, and a library. The third phase of the project will cover a children’s recreation centre, a 100-room self-contained guest house, a multipurpose recreational ground, and a perimeter wall for security. The group will also improve the worship site where the Martyrs Day Services are conducted and work on the Uganda martyrs well and a facility for bottling the water.

The current Archbishop of the Anglican Church in Uganda, the Most Revd Stanley Ntagali is supportive of the development committee’s plan. Archbishop Emeritus Nkoyoyo has called on Christians worldwide and other well-wishers to contribute and help realise this ambitious project, which aims to help invigorate the conservation and appreciation of Uganda’s rich religious heritage among all ages.
