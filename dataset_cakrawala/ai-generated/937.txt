Werribee came into the game having won their last five games, while the Northern Blues had won their last six games in a row and were in the top four. The Blues got off to a faster start. They scored seven goals in the first quarter and led by as many as 28 points at one point. But Werribee came back in the second, thanks in large part to how well young Nick Larkey played. The first-year Roo had a good second quarter and kicked three goals, which put Werribee ahead by one point at halftime. After the break, the game didn't slow down, and the Tigers still had the edge in general play. With one quarter left, they had a 21-point lead after scoring seven more goals and allowing only three. This put them on track to win their sixth game in a row. The Blues made one last push early in the last quarter, but Werribee settled down and won by 20 points, putting it right on the edge of the top four teams. The AFL's Best Andrew Smittle Swallow was dominant all afternoon in his usual position as an inside midfielder, and he had a lot of disposals. He finished with 28 points and seven tackles, which put his name in the running for a spot back in the AFL. The VFL's Best Tom Gribble Gribble had 33 disposals, which was the most of any player on the field. Talking points The second term of Larkey Werribee was behind by almost five goals, but Larkey scored three goals in the second quarter to bring them back. He got the ball through contested marks and marks on the lead. After that, he didn't make any mistakes with his set shots. Ben Dyer, who is in charge of the team's development, told NMFC.com.au after the game, "Nick had a really good game today." "He played as our deepest forward most of the time and was able to step up and give us a really good fight." Thomas's comeback Thomas came back to play after his three-match suspension was over. He was in the middle of the action from the beginning to the end, scoring two goals and getting 12 disposals. Dyer said of Thomas's play, "He ran the game out pretty well." "He worked hard to make sure that pressure was a big part of his game when he came back and helped the other forwards get organized with his knowledge." Swallow scores it. Andrew Swallow has found a lot of the ball in all of his VFL games this season. It happened again on Saturday at Ikon Park, especially early in the game when Werribee was struggling to stay in it. Dyer said of Swallow's performance, "He got us going inside when the game was going against us a little bit." "After the first quarter, he had a tag on him, but he was able to work around it and still contribute." Even if Andrews gets tagged, he does his best work at the point of contact, so it doesn't affect his ability to put pressure on the other team and make tackles." Nielson stays the same. Nielson, Roo Ben's brother, did a great job when he was given the job on Harry McKay. McKay only scored one goal, and Nielson was very important when he had to do desperate things to defend. Dyer said, "Dan thinks that key defenders don't need to get a lot of the ball to do their job." "He was up against a very tough opponent today, so it was great to see Dan compete well against McKay, keep up with him, and win.
