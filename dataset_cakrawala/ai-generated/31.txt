In an interview with Fox News, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said he expects to release a public version of the investigation’s findings “within a week.”

A separate investigation by the Department of Justice’s inspector general is also underway.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to release his report this month.

The investigation into the origin of the Russia probe began in early 2018.

Barr said the investigation will focus on whether intelligence and law enforcement officials acted properly when they opened the Russia investigation.

The investigation has been a source of frustration for President Trump and his allies, who have long accused the FBI and DOJ of bias against Trump.

The president has repeatedly called for the investigation to be shut down, and has called for the officials involved to be held accountable.

On Sunday, he tweeted that Barr “will be giving a major speech on the great progress made in the United States over the last year.”

Barr has previously said that the report will not apportion blame, but will instead focus on whether any laws were violated.

The White House has said that Barr will also outline steps the administration is taking to improve the integrity of the nation’s elections.

The president is scheduled to travel to Singapore on Sunday to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
