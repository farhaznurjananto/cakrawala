Several lines of epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between traffic-related air pollution and adverse health effects, including mortality and morbidity [1–4]. In the past two decades, the health effects of traffic-related air pollution have been investigated through studies that have examined the long-term exposure of individuals to traffic-related air pollution in their place of residence. Results from these studies have shown an association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and mortality [2], lung cancer [5], and cardiopulmonary mortality [6].

The LUR model is a regression model that uses measurements of traffic-related air pollution at a number of sampling sites to estimate the exposure of the entire population. The LUR model has a number of advantages over previous exposure assessment methods, as it allows exposure to be estimated for each individual within the study population. These models have been used extensively in Europe and North America, but there are only a few studies that have used this approach in Asia []. In this paper, we apply the LUR model to estimate exposure to traffic-related air pollution in a metropolitan region in China.

China is currently the world’s most populous country and its economy is the world’s second largest. It is also the world’s fastest-growing major economy. According to the World Bank, the Chinese economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of 6.5% through 2020 [9]. As the Chinese economy continues to grow, the number of vehicles on the road will also increase. In China, the number of registered vehicles increased from 128 million in 2000 to over 500 million in 2016 [10].

In this study, we use data from the China National Air Pollution Surveillance (CNAS) to estimate exposure to traffic-related air pollution in Beijing and Tianjin, two major metropolitan regions in China. We use the 2009–2015 period to estimate exposure, as this was the time period during which the CNAS conducted the largest number of air quality measurements. The CNAS collects air quality data from a network of more than 1,000 air quality monitoring stations across China.
