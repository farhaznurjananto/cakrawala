US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, expressed her satisfaction with the newly approved sanctions on North Korea, calling it “a gut punch” to the country. Speaking to CNN’s Ana Cabrera, Haley warned that military action would be taken if North Korea continues its aggressive actions.

According to Haley, the United States will do whatever it takes to defend themselves and their allies, and the ball is now in North Korea’s court. She added that although the United States hopes for peace and security, North Korea must decide where to go from here.

The Trump administration has been accused of presenting inconsistent messaging about their approach to North Korea. However, Haley asserted that the Trump administration's messageremains consistent: North Korea has acted recklessly and irresponsibly and has to stop. Additionally, the U.S. has made it clear that all options are on the table.

The approved sanctions against North Korea were approved by the United Nations Security Council following their latest nuclear test in September. The sanctions include restrictions on North Korea’s imports of petroleum, bans on textile exports, and measures to prevent the country from exporting labor overseas. The sanctions could potentially cut off all of North Korea's oil supply.

Given the increased tension between North Korea and the United States, it remains to be seen how North Korea will react to the sanctions. Nonetheless, the United States and its allies remain committed to ensuring global peace and security. Should North Korea continue to threaten that security, it seems likely that military action could be taken against them.
