According to a report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Falcons have informed veteran tight end Luke Stocker that they plan to release him.

Stocker was signed by the Falcons last week in an effort to add some veteran depth to the tight end position in Atlanta.

The 31-year-oldStockerspent the past two seasons with the Titans, where he started eight games and caught eight passes last season.

Stocker is the second veteran tight end that the Falcons have released this offseason, as they also let Levine Toilolo walk in free agency.

Toilolo, who had been with the Falcons since he was drafted in 2013, signed with the Lions on a one-year deal.

The Falcons will likely turn to Austin Hooper and Jace Amaro as the team’s starting tight ends going into the 2017 season.

The Falcons are in the process of rebuilding their roster and are hopeful that adding Stocker and releasing Toilolo will give them a better chance to win in 2017.
