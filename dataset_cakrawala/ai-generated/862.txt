The Pittsburgh Steelers have been getting small injuries, which could keep a few players out of their Week 1 game on Monday Night Football against the Washington Redskins. Notable injuries include Cameron Heyward's ankle injury, Anthony Chickillo's ankle injury, and Javon Hargrave's ankle injury (knee). For the first time this season, Mike Tomlin met with the media for his weekly press conference. The head coach talked about the injuries of not only the big names but also some players who have been dealing with nagging injuries leading up to the first game of the season. Tomlin gave a list of people who have injuries that aren't life-threatening: Cameron Hieghton (ankle) Roosevelt Nix (back) Shamarko Thomas (groin) Daniel McCullers (knee) Codey Wallace (knee) Matthias Wheaton (shoulder) Tomlin did mention that rookie nose tackle Javon Hargrave hurt his knee during Monday's practice. He said the injury was checked out and that Hargrave will be day-to-day for the rest of the week. Tomlin said that Senquez Golson, who is not on the team's injured reserve list but is still in a cast after surgery to fix a Lisfranc injury, is week-to-week. This was a bit of a surprise. He said that he was "optimistic" that he would be back in 2016. On Thursday, the Steelers will have their first official injury report practice, where the team will say who practiced, who didn't, and who only did some of the workout.
