In June 1955, something wonderful happened that changed the lives of tens of millions of Soviet citizens: public parks, which gave people a chance to get away from their dull city lives, became free. The fee to get in was the price of a loaf of bread, which was not a small amount in a country that was still poor after the Second World War. But on that day in June, word quickly spread across the 11-time zone country: Thank Jawaharlal Nehru! The Indian prime minister was visiting the Soviet Union at the time, and he became an instant hero to young Soviet men and women without even knowing it. Many of them, who are now in their 70s and 80s, still think of him fondly. The story was told all over the country, but it was never officially reported: The Soviet leaders took Nehru to many places that showed how far socialism had come. The huge Central Park in Moscow was one of those places. Nikita S. Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, his number two, Prime Minister Nikolai A. Bulganin, and a number of other important people, including the mayor of Moscow, went with Nehru to the main entrance of the central park. Nehru suddenly noticed something that his hosts had never noticed and taken for granted: a long line of people waiting at the ticket boxes near the gates. One would expect to see this at a sports stadium on the day of a big game, not at the entrance to a public park on a normal day. Nehru asked these people who they were and why they were waiting in line. His hosts told him that to get into the park, they bought tickets from cashiers. It is thought that Nehru was speechless. He asked again to be sure, but the same answer came back. People think that Nehru's exact words ranged from amazement to admonition. He wanted to know how a communist government in a socialist country could charge people to get into public parks while the British, the US, and other capitalist countries let people into public parks for free. Since 1851, when they opened, the Royal Parks in London have been free for everyone to use. Khrushchev was very embarrassed and very angry. His group didn't know what went wrong, so they looked to their boss for instructions. He told his followers something, and they ran to the ticket booths shouting and waving their hands. The ticket booths were closed right away, and people in the crowd were told that it was free to get in. People who were already inside ran back to get their money back, which caused a small stampede. Overnight, people all over the Soviet Union made phone calls and sent telegrams. The Soviet people were told on the radio in the morning that all public parks were free. In a lot of parks, the metal fences were taken down and the gates were left open, even at night. That was a change in society. Why were there fees to get in to begin with? Most likely, it had to do with how much money the city had in its budget. The Soviet municipal governments were starved for money because they had to take care of public utilities that were too cheap and fix up old housing. The entrance fees to public parks were helpful, especially since the number of paying customers had gone up because of how quickly cities were growing. But once it was clear that these fees weren't right for a socialist country, they were done for. After that, people got a lot of freedom. People could go to public parks more often for fun, family activities, picnics, and dates if they could afford to do so. Everyone was happy and thankful to Nehru, whether they were young or old, athletes or war veterans, families on a picnic or single people on a date. Particularly the last one. Because there were not many other places to go in the Soviet Union, public parks became places to dance and meet people. People had to pay twice: once to get into the park and again for the same price to get into the dance enclosure. Now, because of Nehru, the price had gone down by half. This was a big deal, especially for students, young workers, and apprentices. At the beginning and middle of the 1950s, it was hard to meet people in cities. Young people didn't have a lot of chances to meet and date. There was no way to get to restaurants. A meal at a restaurant cost about 10% of a person's monthly wage. People ate at cheap factory cafeterias and city diners, which weren't exactly romantic. People lived in barracks and crowded apartments with a dozen or more people or more in each room. Young people hung out in shabby places like the back yards and basements of buildings. In each city, there were a few factory clubs and community centers where people could dance, but everyone knew that the bosses were watching. After Nehru, it became less expensive to dance in parks in cities. Strangers would be more likely to meet. There were more and more people to date.
