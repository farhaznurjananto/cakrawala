Two students who are illegal-alien teenagers were recently arrested for raping a 14-year-old girl. The boys were identified as 18-year-old Henry Sanchez, of Guatemala, and 17-year-old Jose Montano, of El Salvador. The assault took place on 16 March at Rockville High School in Maryland, where the two boys approached the girl inside the school building. After she refused Montano's request to engage in sex, the pair forced her into one of the boys’ bathrooms and into a stall where they both attacked her. They raped her both orally and vaginally, and allegedly caused her significant pain. Montgomery County police cited a police report which stated that the boys also raped her anally.

It has been reported that Sanchez was due to be deported to Guatemala while immigration activists tried to block the deportation. He had a pending deportation order, which was not executed. The state of Maryland is one of the most welcoming in the eastern US for illegal aliens and refugees, with Montgomery County being the most accommodating county within the state. The effects of this welcome have engendered debate, with some claiming that the incident demonstrates the problems that mass migration gives rise to.

Sanchez and Montano were living in Rockville's Aspen Hill neighbourhood and have been charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offence. They were denied bail and remanded in custody until their trial. WUSA 9 news confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had requested that Sanchez be detained, as he has a pending deportation order. William Gheen, President of the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC group, said that this is a rare case where the news of a rape of a student on school property managed to leak out into the local media. This he claimed was because rape and assault cases involving illegal aliens are usually suppressed within the school system or local news media.

Maryland is currently considering a bill that would declare the state as the first sanctuary state in America. Maryland gives in-state tuition to illegal-alien college students, and Montgomery County is already a sanctuary county, denying 63 ICE requests to turn over illegal-alien criminals during 2016, according to Fox News. These policies, opponents claim, help to create a culture that encourages immigrants to commit violent acts. The authorities are still investigating the incident.
