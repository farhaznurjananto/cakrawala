With exactly one year remaining until the Women's Hockey World Cup in London, Suffolk's Hannah Martin (far left) appears to be doing nothing to hinder her prospects of making the England team. Getty Pictures Images owned by Getty Images The 22-year-old, who made her senior international debut earlier this year, scored again for England in their 1-1 tie with the United States in the World League Semifinal in South Africa yesterday night. The United States went on to win the subsequent penalty shootout, which means that England will play Argentina for third place on Sunday. Martin has primarily appeared as a substitute at this event in Johannesburg, but has nonetheless impressed with a series of outstanding performances. On Tuesday, she came off the bench to both score and assist on England's 4-1 victory over India. The former Ipswich Schoolgirl, though, is not very enthusiastic about the prospect of playing in a World Cup on home soil. Martin told us, "It's certainly at the forefront of my mind, and it would be incredible to play in front of a large audience with all England games already sold out." "But I must first be selected. If I perform at my highest level on the field and practice as hard as I can, I give myself the best opportunity of making the team."
