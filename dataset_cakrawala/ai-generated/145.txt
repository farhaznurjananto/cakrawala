If the Ottoman Empire had survived, today's world would be very different. The Ottoman Empire was a major power in the world for centuries, and its influence can still be seen in many parts of the world today. The Ottomans were a major force in the development of the modern world, and their influence can be seen in everything from architecture to cuisine. Without the Ottoman Empire, many of the major developments in world history would not have happened. Today, the world would likely be a much different place without the Ottoman Empire.
