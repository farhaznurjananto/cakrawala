The events unfolding in Egypt are dishearteningly reminiscent of the Arab Spring being played in reverse. Where there was once hope of a new era of democracy in the region, the Egyptian military has now announced a puppet president, while the constitution has been torn up, elections and ballot boxes have been discarded, and joyous crowds have filled Tahrir Square to celebrate. The Saudi Arabian monarchy, previously nervous of this new wave of change, has sent their congratulations to the Cairo generals. Western leaders, too, have been lost for words when asked to condemn the coup, instead offering the vague sentiment that Britain prefers civilian rule.

This sentiment appears to have been lost on the people of Egypt, who have seen their hopes for democracy evaporate as the country has plunged into an economic, security, and sectarian crisis. The murder rate has trebled, and with it has come a sense of desperation that has led them to welcome back the military, despite the fact that the situation has been deteriorating since the country elected a president.

The Arab Spring, however, never promised democracy as much as it promised freedom, and the distinction between the two is an important one. The catalyst for the Spring was the desperate act of self-immolation of Tunisian street trader Mohammed Bouazizi, who had grown frustrated by the lack of legal protection for his business. This frustration was echoed by all sixty of the other similar cases of self-immolation, five of which were in Egypt. Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist, investigated the Arabic Spring and found that what motivated Bouazizi was not a political ideology, but a fight for the right to own and acquire capital, something that many of the developing world still cannot do. With a process of acquiring a legal licence so fraught with bribery and bureaucracy, it is no surprise that many in the Arab world are forced to operate in the black market.

The West has been guilty of misreading the Arab Spring and overlooking the demand for this kind of basic freedom. As Margaret Thatcher famously said, “being democratic is not enough – a majority cannot turn what is wrong into right”. It is the strength of institutions, such as the police, the army, and the press, that will ultimately decide if nations rise or fall. If Western leaders are to make any real change in the region, they must demand the extension of property rights in return for their foreign aid, and champion the rights of small traders to buy and sell without fear of persecution or confiscation. Such an action could be the most effective anti-poverty strategy ever devised and may, in time, win back the millions of friends the West has lost in the Arab world.
