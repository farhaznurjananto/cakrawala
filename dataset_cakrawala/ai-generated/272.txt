It’s already a third of the way through National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), and with only a couple of weeks remaining to finish a 50,000-word novel draft, many writers may be feeling the pressure. However, if you’ve yet to hit your word counts, or you haven’t even started yet, do not worry about “wasting” your literary November. The world is filled with published novels waiting for readers. Here are seven books about writing that may make you feel grateful that you’re not in the process of composing a novel, or that might help to reignite your motivation:
 
“Lost for Words” by Edward St. Aubyn
 
In this high-culture, satirical novel, published author-dom can be even more depressing than the unpublished life. St. Aubyn details authors obsessing over whether their latest works will win major literary prizes, while behind the scenes, unscrupulous judges trade favors and skip the reading. Yet, the whole mess is hilarious.
 
“Fates and Furies” by Lauren Groff
 
This literary blockbuster focuses on the same marriage by weaving together two stories of a charming, wildly successful playwright and his beautiful, supportive wife. We’re asked to reconsider our perceptions of the lone genius, as well as our tendency to believe comforting falsehoods, in a shocking twist.
 
“Pale Fire” by Vladimir Nabokov
 
Nabokov is always a good idea, and in “Pale Fire,” the emphasis is on the obsessive tendencies of scholars and superfans within the literary milieu. Charles Kinbote, an ostensibly unhinged admirer of John Shade, the American poet, shares his interpretations of Shade’s poem of the same name. Kinbote's tale of a conspiracy spirals down a confusing, darkened tunnel until we’re almost as lost in the narrative as he is.
 
“The Blind Assassin” by Margaret Atwood
 
Like “Pale Fire,” “The Blind Assassin” is not solely about writing, but is instead a book within a book within a book. Interspersed with Iris Chase’s memories about her upbringing with her dreamy, idealistic sister, Laura, are chapters from a novel inspired by their lives, as well as their friendship with a radical named Alex. The novel itself hides a haunting sci-fi tale about a blind assassin. Atwood explores the numerous chambers of meaning that authors can conceal in their work, along with the power of storytelling to both reveal and conceal the truth.
 
“How Should A Person Be?” by Sheila Heti
 
Heti’s novel-from-life is contemplative, with a narrator who struggles to write a play and spend plenty of time procrastinating. The book highlights the struggles of overcoming writer’s block, along with the character’s less-than-ideal methods for jumpstarting her creative process. By the time you finish “How Should A Person Be?” you’ll feel less alone in your struggles.
 
“Americanah” by Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie
 
Adichie’s novel focuses on a Nigerian college student who ends up staying in New York after graduation, becoming a popular blogger who analyzes blackness and race across continents. Ifemelu makes her way through romantic and professional obstacles while trying to improve her understanding of the country she calls home. “Americanah” underscores the essential need for thoughtful writing, as well as the personal cost it takes on writers.
 
“The Story of My Teeth” by Valeria Luiselli, trans. by Christina MacSweeney
 
Written to be read aloud to Mexican factory workers, “The Story of My Teeth” focuses on why stories matter. The protagonist, an auctioneer and chronic liar, weaves mythical tales about his dental history, his past, and the items he’s auctioning. Although readers don’t always know what's true and what’s not within the novel, Luiselli suggests that the thrill of the story has inherent value.
