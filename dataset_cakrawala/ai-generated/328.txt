Obama's Farewell Address: More Sentimental Rhetoric Than Action?

During his farewell speech, former US President Barack Obama reminded his countrymen about the importance of working together. While these words may hold some value, for many Americans, words are not what they need – they require action.

CNN offers the best possible interpretation of economic indicators for black Americans, who have seen their median income stagnate along with the rest of the population. Median income for blacks stood at $35,398 in 2014, just a touch below where it was in 2009, when Obama took office. While income for the African Americans has seen a slight increase, it is still not enough. The Great Recession led many Americans into poverty, but African Americans were hit particularly hard. The poverty rate for blacks hit 27.6% in 2011, nearly 2 percentage points higher than what it was when Obama was sworn in. It has since receded to 26.2%.

This deeply unfulfilling result seems to reflect the fact that Obama ignored his country’s most pressing issue during his presidency -- the lack of decent paying jobs. His closest advisors thought he would come out swinging and do everything possible to create jobs after being elected. That is what Americans wanted, too. They were shocked when he chose Obamacare out of the gate as his first priority. What was perhaps intended to be a good move has created a massive mess instead.

But why the lack of action from Obama? The answer is simple: he is a globalist. People are aware that he was plucked out of nowhere by the Trilateral Commission, the single most important globalist force in the world, alongside David Rockefeller. Out of the 87 members of the commission that are US citizens, Obama appointed 11 of them to key posts in his administration.

The Trilateral Commission's primary ideology revolves around limiting job creation in America in order to torpedo its economy. Obama chose to ignore his country’s most pressing issue during his presidency because of his belief in the globalist agenda. For all of his talk about discrimination, social justice, and prejudice, his words fall flat, as he has never taken action to correct the true cause of the problems Americans face.

Although "we’re all in this together" does sound like a noble philosophy, it doesn't make pernicious globalist trade treaties disappear, nor does it create jobs for people who are willing and ready to work and support their families. It definitely doesn’t eliminate gangs, killings, drugs, and highly dangerous neighborhoods. It's time for America to take real action, and Obama's sentimental rhetoric is not enough to make this happen.
