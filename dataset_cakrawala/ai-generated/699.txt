Nintendo of America has confirmed that it has no intentions of selling its majority stake in the Seattle Mariners professional baseball team, according to Mariners chairman and CEO Howard Lincoln, who is also a member of the Nintendo of America board of directors.

This news surfaces after the recent passing of former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. Yamauchi held the position of majority owner of the club until 2004 when he transferred ownership to Nintendo of America.

"In times like this, there's always speculation," Lincoln informed the Puget Sound Business Journal. "Speaking on behalf of Nintendo of America, I can say that Nintendo has no plans to sell its majority interest in the Mariners."

Following a 10-day fishing trip in Alaska where communication was limited, Lincoln discovered the news of Yamauchi's passing late Thursday. Having known and worked under Yamauchi for more than 30 years, Lincoln said, "He was a man of small stature and commanding presence. People liked him. He was charismatic and warm. He was a true visionary. We must remember all he did for Seattle and the Northwest."

Under Yamauchi's guidance, Nintendo evolved from a trading card company to a pioneer in the gaming industry, introducing ground-breaking gaming hardware like the NES and popular arcade games such as Donkey Kong in the 1980s. Yamauchi facilitated the establishment of multiple development studios that would generate some of the gaming world's most influential characters.

Yamauchi played a crucial role in supporting professional baseball in Seattle as well, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. In 1992, Yamauchi became the majority owner of the Seattle Mariners, preventing then-owner Jeff Smulyan from selling the team to a group in Florida.

In 2004, Yamauchi transferred ownership of the Seattle Mariners to Nintendo of America, relinquishing his official ownership of the club. Despite this, the media continued to regard him as the "titular owner" even after the transfer.

Lincoln concluded by saying, "I can't predict the future, but for now Nintendo is adamant about maintaining its ownership interest in the Mariners."
