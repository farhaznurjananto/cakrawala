Houston Texans' middle linebacker DeMeco Ryans has taken on an essential dual role for his team as the NFL lockout continues into its fourth month. Ryans is the Texans' player representative, responsible for keeping his teammates up-to-date with the latest developments in the ongoing labour dispute alongside right tackle Eric Winston. Furthermore, coaches cannot contact players for the time being, and therefore Ryans has undertaken the role of teaching the new defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips' 3-4 scheme to the team. Houston's defence ranked as one of the league's worst in 2010, and Ryans is looking to make sure that the team bounces back in 2020.

On Monday morning, around 35 Texans players, including quarterback Matt Schaub, defensive end Mario Williams and linebacker Brian Cushing, participated in an 80-minute voluntary practice held at Rice University. Many of these players have come to Houston to help Ryans teach the team Phillips' new system. Among them were drafted prospects like Shiloh Keo, Brooks Reed, and T.J. Yates.

For the quarterbacks, Schaub began by taking his teammates through a series of warm-up drills before splitting the team, depending on their positions. For the final half of the practice, the group mostly scrimmaged without pads. Schaub believes that working as a team in the long-term will serve them well when the season resumes.

Ryans is still recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, which kept him off the field for the final ten games of last season. During the voluntary practice, Ryans referred to the playbook and made repeated calls to ensure that the players understood his point. Repetition during these practices would help the team, Ryans said, but every NFL team requires extended training camp practices to equip themselves correctly for the season. Currently, the ongoing lockout prohibits the required training.

Ryans is "encouraged" by the meetings that have taken place between team representatives and the NFL officials, optimistic that progress is being made for a fair deal. However, he could not offer a timeline for when the parties would come to an agreement. Ryans mentioned that a fair deal would be on the table soon, and that is when it will get done.

Regarding the draft, Shiloh Keo, a fifth-round pick and a safety, says he is trying to put the lockout out of his mind. Instead, he is focused on learning the game and impressing his new teammates.

The Texans defense needs all the practice it can get, specifically the secondary, with or without coaches. Houston's pass defense ranked last (268 yards per game) in the 2010 NFL season, and they need an immediate turnaround to compete. Kareem Jackson was often the scapegoat for Houston's secondary problems last year, and fellow cornerback Glover Quin also showed up for the workout. Quin will transition to safety in Phillips' new defensive scheme, and he believes that these voluntary off-season workouts are crucial for the team to learn the system.
