 According to a congressional aide, Israel wants $5 billion a year in military aid for 10 years, totaling her $50 billion. She has suggested that she wants more funding to counter threats she says stem from international agreements on Iran's nuclear program, which the Israeli government is adamantly opposed to. 
 Members of Congress and other US officials warned that negotiations for a new aid deal were still in their early stages, and that the proposal had yet to be formally submitted to Congress, where Congress had to approve the funding. "First they have to negotiate with the White House," the senior congressional aide said of Israel. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington next week to meet with President Barack Obama, where the package is likely to be discussed and its outline agreed. 
 A spokesman for the Israeli government  declined to provide details of the defense assistance negotiations. 
 US officials said it was unlikely the Obama administration would fully comply with Israel's demands.
