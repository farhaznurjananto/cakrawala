Robert Curvin, an advocate for the city of Newark and a scholar devoted to alleviating urban poverty, passed away at the age of 81 on Tuesday in his home in the Vailsburg section of the city due to multiple myeloma, according to his wife Patricia. Throughout his life, Dr. Curvin passionately served Newark in various capacities, leaving a remarkable legacy of leadership and scholarship that will continue to inspire generations to come. 

Born in Cranford, New Jersey, in 1940, Robert Curvin graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962 with a degree in mathematics. After graduation, he became a civil rights activist, co-founding the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in Newark, where he would remain committed for the rest of his life. As a member of CORE, Curvin played an instrumental role in the movement for integrated construction jobs in Newark in the early 1960s.

Robert Curvin's commitment to social justice led him to pursue academic studies, graduating with honors from Princeton University in 1970 with a doctorate in politics. As a scholar, Dr. Curvin focused his research on the political economy of urban America and the roots of poverty, becoming a prominent expert in the field of urban studies. He was appointed as a dean of the New School in Manhattan in 1991 where he also taught as a professor at the Milano Graduate School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy. 

Dr. Curvin was a genuinely devoted advocate for Newark throughout his career, working tirelessly for the community's empowerment and improvement. He was instrumental in making Kenneth A. Gibson the first black mayor of a major northeastern city when he won the election in Newark in 1970. He also served on the editorial board of The New York Times for nearly six years, where he wrote extensively on urban politics, civil rights, race relations, and the socio-economic challenges of poverty. Moreover, Dr. Curvin worked for the Ford Foundation in its urban and community development program.

Despite the challenges that Newark has to face, such as educational and employment issues, Dr. Curvin never lost his hope and tenacity to bring about positive changes to the community he loved. He was realistic about the outlook for Newark, including the city's issues, and he was frank about his disappointment in the city's mayors. However, he continued to work for the city's betterment, serving as a member of the Newark Public Library's board of trustees and working as a consultant for the Newark Alliance.

Robert Curvin's life will be remembered as an example of selfless leadership devoted to improving the community he loved deeply. His passing is a significant loss for Newark and for the world of urban studies, where he played such an essential role. However, his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of scholars and leaders to work tirelessly for social justice and progress, creating a world that is more equitable and just for all.
