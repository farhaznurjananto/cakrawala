Title: The Importance of Organic Matter in Soil and How to Maintain It

Organic matter plays a crucial role in soil health, serving as a reservoir of nutrients and water, reducing compaction and surface crusting, and increasing water infiltration. However, it is often misunderstood and neglected. This article seeks to clarify the concept of organic matter, explore its benefits, and provide guidance on how to maintain or improve its presence in soil.

Organic matter is the decomposed product of organic material, which consists of plant and animal residues found in or on the soil. For organic material to become organic matter, it must be broken down into humus, a decomposed state that is resistant to further decomposition. Organic matter is stable within the soil, in contrast to organic material, which is unstable and transforms rapidly as it decomposes.

An acre of soil measuring up to a depth of six inches weighs approximately 2,000,000 pounds. If 1% of this weight is organic matter, that equates to around 20,000 pounds per acre. Adding 1% stable organic matter to soil under favorable conditions requires at least 200,000 pounds (100 tons) of organic material.

Soils formed under prairie vegetation typically have higher levels of organic matter than those formed under forest vegetation. This is because prairie vegetation supplies organic material from both its top growth and roots, while forest vegetation produces a smaller root mass per acre and does not decompose annually, resulting in a lower amount of organic material present in the soil.

The benefits of organic matter in soil include nutrient supply, improved water-holding capacity, enhanced soil structure aggregation, and erosion prevention. To maintain or improve soil organic matter levels, several practices can be implemented, such as reducing or eliminating tillage, reducing erosion, properly conducting soil tests and fertilizing, and using cover crops in combination with tillage reduction and erosion control measures.

A healthy supply of soil organic matter provides numerous advantages in crop or forage production. By understanding the importance of this valuable resource and implementing strategies to build or maintain organic matter, soil health can be preserved and improved.
