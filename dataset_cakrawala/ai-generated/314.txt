the industry. The focus shifted towards creator-owned books, and the allure of the Big Two publishers waned. At the same time, Marvel began to poach some of DC’s top talent for their own line. DC responded by catering to a narrower group of creators. They leaned on the same names over and over, which led to a diminishing talent pool. Those creators were stretched thin, and the books they produced suffered. The low sellers only hurt the line more, and newer, more innovative voices were given fewer opportunities.

The industry has gotten better about this in recent years, recognizing the importance of diverse voices both in front of and behind the page. But DC allowed themselves to fall behind, and the creators they relied on became spread too thin. It was a vicious cycle that led to a lot of generic, uninspired content.

3. Too Many Line Wide Crossovers

For those unaware, a “line wide crossover” is when an event happening in one book requires readers to buy every other book in the line to understand what’s going on. It’s a trick that worked well for Marvel in the late ’90s and early 2000s, but it’s become one of the most-heavily criticized practices in modern comics.

DC did an admirable job of avoiding line wide crossovers in the New 52. But they came back in a big way after the line shifted to DC You in 2015. Convergence was the first big offender, a two-month event that ran concurrently with the end of one line and the beginning of another.

But the real damage came from the Darkseid War. The storyline was massive, spanning across not just Justice League, but key books like Batman and Superman as well. And while it was an interesting story, it required fans to buy 15-20 different books to fully understand what was going on. For fans of Batman or Wonder Woman who didn’t care about the other books, it was a frustrating practice that didn’t appeal to them. Even worse, the tie-ins to Darkseid War weren’t even always relevant to the story. It was a blatant attempt to sell more books, and fans weren’t pleased.

4. Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen

At this point, I don’t think anyone has a firm grip on who’s responsible for DC Comics. When New 52 hit, there were rumors that editor-in-chief Dan Didio had been pushed to the sideline when it came to decision making. Co-Publishers Jim Lee and Dan DiDio were in charge, but both operated in different segments of the company. Neither seemed to have the final say over anything.

With the launch of DC You, things didn’t seem to change. Both co-publishers were still in place, but they oversaw a line that felt like it was trying to please everyone. It was tough to get a sense of direction for the line, and without that, it was hard for creators to follow any sort of cohesive path.

The line suffered because of it, and retailers struggled to understand what their customers even wanted. Didio’s role as a publisher and co-head of the company was unclear, and it didn’t seem like anyone had a strong vision for the company’s future. That lack of direction led to wider problems throughout the line.

Looking Ahead

So what’s next for DC Comics? For starters, they need to reevaluate what they’ve been doing. That doesn’t mean they should stop the good things they’ve done. Books like Batman, Grayson and Superman: American Alien have been popular, and while they might not have hit the top of the charts, they’ve been consistent sellers for a turbulent line. Second, they need to rebuild their core audience. It’s impossible to say whether Rebirth, the upcoming event in June, will do that, but it’s their best bet to make amends with their fanbase. 

But most importantly, DC needs to learn how to release fewer books and focus on quality content. Rather than stretch themselves thin and try to be something for everyone, they should focus on a few quality books that define the brand. If they’re able to do that, they’ll be well on their way to reclaiming their spot at the top of the industry. It’s a long road ahead, but DC has always been good at bouncing back.
