A Polish historian has reportedly been deported from Russia, just a day after delivering a lecture on the fate of Polish citizens during the late 1930s Stalinist purges. Moscow has previously accused Warsaw of unleashing a "war" against Soviet monuments in Poland, where the Soviet role in World War II is viewed with ambiguity or hostility. In Russia, the official story is that the Red Army liberated Poland from Nazi occupation.
