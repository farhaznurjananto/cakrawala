In a year of unprecedented tumult in American politics, voters are struggling to find enthusiasm for either of the two major presidential nominees. With astronomical unfavorability ratings, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are perceived as the "lesser of two evils" by a nation struggling to come to terms with the surprising results of the primaries. 

While Trump is widely unrated on account of his outspokenness and inexperience in politics, Clinton is criticized as being an ultimate insider, with a reputation for scandals and secrecy. Although many Trump supporters remain ardent in their enthusiasm for the unconventional political outsider, others are beginning to worry that his hasty, at times divisive language and tendency to attack anyone and everyone who disagrees with him could cost him the election. Even within the Republican ranks, concern mounts that Trump could wound party unity and hand the Presidency over to his opponent, Hillary Clinton. 

For many, the biggest obstacle in voting for Clinton is not how she would handle foreign policy or economic matters, but rather the feeling that voters know her too well. Despite her years of public service, the former Secretary of State appears to leave many cold, with concerns over her trustworthiness rippling through the electorate. Even some who are committed to her as the best choice seem more motivated by their sense of Trump as a potentially "threat to democracy" who would leave America in a worse state than ever. 

However, even as the country struggles to find enthusiasm for either candidate, this year’s election cycle is beginning to be seen as a truly historic turning point in American politics. With the stakes high and the landscape rapidly devolving, many are still reserving judgment, waiting for the candidates to make their cases and the debates to decide their perceived merits. For minority communities, this is already proving to be a deeply divisive and intimidating election cycle, as fears over rhetoric targeting their ethnicity have infused the public discourse. Yet some feel that the prospect of such large-scale change is energizing voters and bringing them out in record numbers.

Regardless of their beliefs on the merits, the overwhelming majority of those interviewed agree the stakes are unquestionably high, with all recognizing that November’s results may entirely reshape the political landscape in ways that we cannot yet predict.
