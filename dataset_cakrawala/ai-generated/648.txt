Ahmed al-Sha'ara journeyed across Europe and through Turkey with his sons, ultimately joining forces to challenge President Bashar al-Assad, according to the Egyptian al-Aram website. Among those with him was his 13-year-old son Osama who had previously attended demonstrations in Tangiers, northern Morocco, against the imprisonment of Salafists, who are radical Sunni Muslims. 

If these reports are confirmed, it would support the notion that increasing numbers of large family groups from the Muslim world are traveling to Syria. Shiraz Maher, a researcher at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College in London, explained that many families from the Caucasus and Central Asia have been seen entering Syria, often with infant children. Maher estimates that at least one family crosses into Syria every month. 

He also predicts that European women will start to join their families in Syria, given the extensive online interaction between jihadis in Syria and women from European countries. According to Maher, once the families are in Syria, they form a type of home front, where the women maintain the households and instill extremist values in their children, thus nurturing the next generation of fighters. 

As a result of Assad's dictatorship, which is dominated by the Alawite sect and Shia Muslims, Sunni extremists from northern Africa, Europe, the Middle East and other regions have flocked to join the fight against the Assad regime. The rebellion against Assad has become dominated by Islamist groups, many of which are linked to al-Qaeda, and have taken control of major portions of the country. Intelligence sources have informed The Daily Telegraph that British Muslims comprise the largest number of approximately 1,000 Westerners fighting with Islamist groups in Syria.
