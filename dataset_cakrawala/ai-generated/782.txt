 In late September, a handful of CEOs leading consumer-focused initiatives supported by the Affordable Care Act traveled to Denver to seek answers.  
 The past year has been difficult. Their company struggled, suffered from deficits, and faced growing operational challenges. Several co-ops have already closed and regulators are considering a few more. The fledgling insurance company needed more support from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  to survive. Most importantly, it required much more money. 
 Within months, cooperatives were seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government through the ACA's Corridor of Risk program. They  soon discover that only a small fraction of the money is actually being transported. The decision will put eight co-operatives out of business and hurt several others, attracting national attention and prompting a congressional investigation. More than 500,000 people will suddenly have to find new health insurance. But when they arrived in Denver for several meetings with CMS officials, cooperative leaders offered hope. As Co-op executives, former CMS employees, and others close to the process have told SNL, CO-OP programs are already built to fail thanks to  partisan politics and government mismanagement. What could have been one of the ACA's most innovative concepts has become the  taxpayer-backed albatross.  risk corridor wave
