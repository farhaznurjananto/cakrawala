 Sobek is one of the gods playable  in SMITE. 
  Hunter, Guardian, Destroyer, Menace. The crocodile god Sobek swims where the Nile takes him and pledges no allegiance to anyone. 
 Dark He helped create the world, as some say  Sobek was there when only  Waters existed. Some say that Sobek created the Nile with his sweat to protect those who traveled in his honor, or he would destroy them. Some say that Sobek guides the worthy dead through the Nile into the afterlife, helping them to be reborn and restoring their  sight and strength. Some say he is evil and hateful, terrorizing coastal peoples and terrorizing villages. In fact, Sobek is all  these things and nothing. 
 Sobek is not a god of good and evil, a god of mercy, and a god of malice. He is a god who watches over that  mighty current and takes responsibility for the souls that pass by. he will do the rest of the time
