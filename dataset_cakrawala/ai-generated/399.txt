Russia’s Uralvagonzavod corporation (UVZ) has found a solution to help countries using Russia's most mass-produced second-generation main battle tank (called the T-72) to overcome the challenge of ageing equipment, especially during the transition of military operations from the field to urban conditions. According to Vyacheslav Khalitov, UVZ’s Deputy Director for Special Equipment, the project is based on Russia's war experience in Syria, where the battle is mostly fought in the cities. Khalitov asserted that no one fights in the open anymore since it leads to instant destruction. His team has analysed the wars in Iraq and the Middle East, and they have found the best way to modernize the T-72 to fight effectively in urban environments. UVZ is now developing a special set of additional protection systems that can be installed on the vehicle at the right moment, giving the T-72 a new life.

The modernization of the T-72 for urban warfare involves integrating protection systems, which will enhance the tank's firepower. The integration of the tank will include a more efficient fire-control system with the Sosna multi-channel sighting system, an upgraded 2A46M cannon, and an autoloader modified to fire missiles. The T-72 tank will have a bulldozer blade that clears all rubble and debris caused by collapsing buildings and other structures, making passages. Additionally, a cockpit window will be mounted on the T-72 to protect the tank commander from fire that can come from all sides. The cockpit will offer the commander all-round visibility and mostly come with protective armor.

Moreover, the tank will have reactive armor tiles on all sides to protect the turret's hull and track skirts from shelling. The modernized T-72 will also have the latest electronic warfare devices to suppress all signals sent to an explosive device. The equipment that suppresses radio-controlled explosive devices will be mounted on two inconspicuous devices behind the turret, similar to antennas. Urban conflict conditions require designers to improve the tank's armor from a technical point of view. Shelling from all directions is possible, making large angles of gun elevation needed to fire at the upper floors of buildings. Good visibility conditions for those operating the weapons are also necessary. In Israel, for example, two or three extra machine guns are mounted on the roof of a tank to hit the enemy in the upper floors of buildings.

The T-72 tank will be equipped with various state-of-the-art electronic devices to guarantee a successful operation in an urban environment. The new version of the tank will be shown to potential customers at KADEX 2016, the Fourth International Exhibition of Arms and Military Equipment, to be held in Astana, Kazakhstan.
