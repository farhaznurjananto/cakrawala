On Friday, Hulman & Company CEO Mark Miles appeared on the IMS Radio Network to discuss various hot topics surrounding the 2016 IndyCar schedule, which has yet to be confirmed. This upcoming schedule is expected to have several alterations from its 2015 counterpart, and Miles addressed some key changes during the interview. 

One of the main issues discussed was the loss of Auto Club Speedway, which hosted arguably the most thrilling race of the season until now. Miles stated that they believed it to be a great track with fantastic racing, but there were some issues which they couldn't overlook. "One thing we collectively couldn't get over was that they would like to be the finale. We would like them to be the finale - we'd love to be on a superspeedway at the conclusion of the championship, but they also need to be at night," he said.

Miles explained that the timing of the event was a significant concern, especially given the time zone difference between the east coast and Auto Club Speedway. They were uncomfortable with the event ending at 1 am on the east coast and then proceeding to crown the champion. He admitted: "Our paddock understands that. In the end, we have to reach more people, and it's hard to do early in the morning. I do hope people ultimately realize, that as a series, we need to crown our champion when a lot of people are paying attention."

Miles then delved further into the details of the 2016 IndyCar schedule, stating that it would start earlier and end later while maintaining "about the same amount of races." The season is set to kick off in mid-March, likely with the St. Petersburg race currently scheduled for March 13th. The season will wrap up in the middle of September, and the latest confirmed race at this time is the Labor Day weekend event on the streets of Boston.

Regarding the imminent return of the Phoenix International Raceway to the IndyCar calendar, Miles added that there had been "a lot of talk," and alluded that they were close to finalizing the deal: "(There's been) a lot of talk about Phoenix, and it’s no secret we’re close to the finish line to get it back on the calendar."
