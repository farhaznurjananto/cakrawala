According to a report by Citizens Advice (CAB), a typical household that seeks assistance from debt advisors has no real chance of being able to pay off their debts in their lifetime. The charity has revealed that individuals seeking help with their debts usually owe an average of £16,971, which would take them approximately 93 years to pay off. CAB suggests that low income, over-commitment, illness or disability, and job loss were the primary reasons for individuals’ debts. Starting in April, a new alternative to bankruptcy, called Debt Relief Orders, will come into effect, allowing eligible individuals who own minimal assets and have debts below £15,000 to write off their debts without having to file full-blown bankruptcy. The CAB further calls for fair treatment by creditors and government schemes to assist individuals in debt without the need for court intervention. The report was based on a study of the finances of 1,407 individuals in England and Wales who sought help from the charity with their debt problems in July 2008. The data was compared to similar studies carried out in 2001 and 2004, revealing that the latest figures suggest an ever-increasing “debt crisis” among UK households. The study discovered that the average CAB client seeking help with debt owed two-thirds more than those seen by the charity seven years prior. More than 50% of clients had priority bill debts, for items such as fuel bills, council tax, mortgage repayments or rent, and approximately one in ten had more than ten credit debts, including plastic cards, overdrafts, and personal loans. CAB’s chief executive, David Harker, explained that low income, combined with irresponsible lending and badly-informed financial decisions, were the primary causes of clients’ debt problems. He asserted that many of these clients face a future of poverty, overshadowed by an insurmountable debt burden.
