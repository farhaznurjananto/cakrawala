The current novel therapeutic approach emphasizes the use of multifunctional compounds, with diverse biological properties and a single bioavailability and pharmacokinetic metabolism, to yield significant advantages in treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In line with this reasoning, a new class of cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors has been developed by integrating the propargyl moiety of the irreversible selective MAO-B inhibitor, the neuroprotective/neurorestorative anti-Parkinsonian drug rasagiline, into the "N-methyl" position of the ChE inhibitor and anti-AD drug rivastigmine.

The inhibitory effects of these new compounds, known as the MT series, were initially assessed for their impact on MAO and ChE both in vitro and in vivo. Among this series, MT-031 demonstrated greater potency as a dual MAO-A and ChE inhibitor when compared to other compounds in acutely treated mice. Furthermore, MT-031 was found to increase the striatal levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), while also preventing the metabolism of DA and 5-HT.

In addition to these results, MT-031 exhibited a neuroprotective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neurotoxicity and reactive oxygen species generation in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest that MT-031 is a potent, brain-permeable, multifunctional, neuroprotective, and MAO-A/ChE inhibitor that retains some of the beneficial properties of its parent drugs, rasagiline and rivastigmine, in a single molecule. Consequently, MT-031 shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for treating Alzheimer's disease.
