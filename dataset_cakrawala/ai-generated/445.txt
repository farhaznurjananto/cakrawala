A new tax reform bill proposed by the GOP could put an end to tax-exempt bonds being used for construction projects, including new stadiums. Currently, stadium developers often rely on these sorts of bonds to pay for new complexes, as interest rates are lower, and the bonds are exempt from Federal tax. However, the move to reduce stadium subsidies is one that has long been discussed across various political platforms.

Back in 2015, former President Barack Obama's budget raised the idea of eliminating tax exemptions for stadium bonds, while last year the Brookings Institution suggested that the federal government had spent $3.2bn on subsidising stadium construction projects since 2000.

However, President Donald Trump brought this discussion back into the conversation again last month when he tweeted, “Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!”

Supporters, both Democrat and Republican, of cutting these subsidies propose a stronger stance towards investing taxpayers' money into alternative projects, as they believe that these deals primarily benefit wealthy team owners. Although the NFL contends that the building of new stadiums drives economic growth, most economists feel that the cities never fully recoup their expenses. 

The new tax reform proposal has some lawmakers concerned that communities building stadium projects will need to finance them through alternative sources. The possibility is, that once the tax changes come into being, perhaps as early as January 2018, bond investors will likely demand higher interest rates. 

The lack of a tax exemption may lead to a reduction in the number of cities that can afford to contribute to a stadium deal as cities are competing against fixed suppliers. Cities don't have the ability to create new football teams, and therefore must entice a franchise to come to their location. Hence, cities will compete to attract the limited number of teams left for relocation.

At the beginning of 2017, Senators James Lankford, Republican from Oklahoma, and Cory Booker, Democrat from New Jersey, introduced a bill to end the subsidies provided for stadium construction, and this year Rep. Steve Russell, also Republican from Oklahoma, proposed a similar Bill in the House of Representatives. Investigations carried out by Brookings found that Las Vegas suffered the risk of cost overruns, as expenses could snowball while it waited to entice a team to move there. 

Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who initially supported the stadium funding deal said that Vegas could ultimately end up on the hook for more money with the bill coming in and argues that it “will take money away from our communities and hamper infrastructure nationwide.”

Aside from this sports provision, the bill proposes to get rid of a tax deduction many universities use to get donors to purchase season tickets while also introducing a new 20% tax on salaries of public university employees making over $1m that often includes baseball and basketball coaches. Many schools need booster funds to allow for supporters to buy tickets, but the elimination of the tax exemption could lead to less revenue, which would directly affect non-revenue sports programs. The new tax could work out to be a significant cost to universities, which would have to stay within the tax-free threshold to keep pay rates.

While most on the impact sports franchises, stadium construction, coaches and sports programs for universities, it is unsure what Netflix and other streaming giants might face under the proposal, regarding taxes. Streaming video content providers experiencing strong gains due to a rise in subscribers and rising prices. Netflix shares have recorded a 60% boost this year. At present, these businesses are not included in the same tax bracket as cable TV providers, unlike their broadcast peers who are typically subject to the "double taxation" of being charged Federal tax and then tax by the state as well. Younger consumers increasingly prefer streaming services over traditional cable services, which companies such as Netflix have capitalised on to grow their businesses. But while consumers continue to find lower costs on online streaming services, the tax benefits might very well disappear under the new tax reform proposal currently before Congress.
