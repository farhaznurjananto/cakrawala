Do you want to hear something sad? I know exactly what it takes to make Metal Blast a very successful magazine, or what I need to do to make our interviews and articles go viral. I have to tell a lie. Really, all I have to do is make stuff up as I go, take things out of context, pretend that things were different than they were, and sit back and watch our visitor count grow and grow. Kristian "Gaahl" Eivind Espedal and I met in a Bergen bar. I could tell you it was a dark S&M dungeon because it was a chill upper-crust organic wine bar with soft saxophone music playing in the background. He was polite and kind from the start, despite the fact that he was frightening, violent, and intimidating. I could tell you that I felt he came on to me or that I was intimidated by his presence, both of which are unprovable because they are simply part of my own perception. I could, but none of those statements would be true. And, let's face it, there's already plenty of sensationalist and untrue coverage of this man. Call me stupid (and there is definitely some stupidity at work here), but I don't want to profit or gain popularity by lying. We started Metal Blast with the intention of bringing serious journalism to a field where honesty and seriousness are hard to come by, and for what it's worth, we're sticking to that ideal. [divider] We cannot grow if we do not allow others to express themselves. Blast of Metal: When I scheduled the interview, I went out of my way to emphasize that we were not attempting to create a sensation, as I have noticed in your interviews. They are often very biased in their attempts to make black metal in general, and you in particular, appear as ridiculous or "evil" as possible. What do you believe is the most common misconception perpetuated by this type of coverage? Gaahl: I'm not sure because I haven't followed it. When I went through the Vice documentary footage because they wanted to know what I thought, there were things I reacted against, but the main elements that are incorrectly explained are what they are talking about. Because they have a bad memory and mix up stories, this is where most things go wrong. Many of the subjects they mixed up were true stories, but they were combining several stories into one. I believe it is simply because they are not used to using memory as a source, but rather recordings or texts. MB: During Rotting Christ's tour with God Seed and Cradle of Filth, I spoke with Sakis Tolis, the singer, and he mentioned how you were a very nice person to tour with, despite the "evil" image that has been painted about you. Is this image bothering you in any way? G: No, I can't work around the perceptions of others. Finally, if people have any intelligence, they will see through and understand that things are heavily tainted by the media and how it wishes to portray them through misunderstandings and misconceptions. People frequently narrow down a subject by their own ability to be themselves, so I've never seen this as a problem; if people jump to conclusions, it's because they themselves are in that narrow space. It doesn't bother me if they don't understand me or paint me in their own image; that's just the way people are. I always assume that people have the same understanding and knowledge as me, which is not always the case, but I always speak to them as if they do. [Laughs] When I communicate with people, I never think that they have a different opinion of me. Of course, this is the wrong way to look at things, but it's something I do unconsciously. MB: If I'm not mistaken, you identify as a pagan, also known as Asa. tru G: If one needs to put a name on it, that's probably where most people would place me. MB: At the same time, there is a constant reference to the Judeo-Christian image of Satan in (what used to be) Gorgoroth, God Seed, and black metal in general. You also stated in "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" that Satan was the inspiration for Gorgoroth. So, is it a metaphorical use of "Satan," or is there a connection with this Judeo-Christian entity despite the paganism? G: It has more symbolic meaning, but with Gorgoroth, the intention was very clear and outspokenly against the Judeo-Christian world.
