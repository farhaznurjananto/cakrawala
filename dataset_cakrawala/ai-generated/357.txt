"Last-place Aversion": Evidence and Redistributive Implications is a research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in July 2011. The paper hypothesizes that individuals belonging to low-income groups often oppose redistribution because of their fear of being in last place. To elucidate the concept, the paper conducted laboratory experiments where participants had a selection of gambles with the potential to move them out of the last position. The results showed that individuals rejected gambles that failed to move them out of that position when placed randomly in different distribution levels. Similarly, in money-transfer games, individuals randomly placed in second-to-last place were less willing to donate money to other players despite being in a financially stable position.

The study contends that this innate reluctance to fall behind predicts that people who earn just above the minimum wage are more likely to oppose minimum-wage increases. This is because an increase in minimum wages will push a new group into the lowest position, thus creating competition for those who were previously considered at the bottom. The paper confirmed this hypothesis using survey data analysis.

The study suggests the concept of a "last-place aversion" which describes the reluctance to be at the bottom even at the expense of gaining more significant benefits. The authors concluded that such behavior potentially undermines support for redistributive policies, a pertinent issue that policymakers must consider while implementing socioeconomic programs.

The report's authors acknowledged that the study had significant limitations since it relied on laboratory experiments and surveys to analyze the behavior of a small group of individuals. Nonetheless, the research provides valuable insights regarding the psychology of people concerning their economic situation and can assist policymakers in designing better programs to ensure fair redistribution of wealth.
