Today's release of an annual study on education quality in the United States put Florida 29th with a grade of C. The report rated and ranked each of the fifty states. The Sunshine State performed marginally better this year than it did last year, when it was rated 30th in the nation, but roughly the same as it has in recent years, according to Education Week's "Quality Counts" survey. The survey rates the states based on multiple characteristics, such as student achievement and school funding. Massachusetts once again received the highest grade, a B, while Nevada received the lowest, a D. Like in previous years, Florida scored 11th for K-12 success but received a F for school funding, as it placed 45th and received a F rating. Florida's overall rating of C is equivalent to the nation's overall grade of C.

In 2011, Florida placed fifth in the nation according to the yearly study, a position praised by state education officials. Yet, after education policies were factored into the rankings, Florida's policies aligned with those Education Week favored in its calculations. Since then, the newspaper has revised its rating methodology to place greater emphasis on other characteristics, and Florida has not performed as well. Pam Stewart, Florida's commissioner of education, stated that the report places too much emphasis on "inputs" rather than outcomes. "Unfortunately, the Quality Counts Report focuses an inordinate emphasis on funding levels without considering student performance, dismissing the state's exceptional return on investment in education," she said in a statement. Stewart stated that the graduation rate for the class of 2016 in Florida was the best in decades and that the state ranks highly for student success and growth on national exams.
