Once upon a time, in a land of pizza-making knights and dough-tossing heroes, an astonishingly bitter voicemail left my phone tainted with the venomous hisses of a Papa John's Pizza worker. As an African-American gem of the community, who believes in showering delivery givers with bountiful tips above 21%, I was engulfed by the sheer horror and distaste this message sparked in me.

The mystery lingers: where were the valiant knightsmanagers and supervisors, guardians of decorum, when this atrocity transpired in the hallowed halls of the workplace? Though freedom of speech allows all to whisper and shout their opinions, let us remember that there is a fitting moment and place for every thought shared.

Thus, I beseech the mighty realm of Papa John's to look beyond the conquests of "better ingredients" and "better pizza" and turn their gaze upon the noble quests of embodying "better integrity" and gathering "better people" within their kingdom.

In that wretched voicemail, an eerie, mostly inaudible conversation weaved its way between two souls for about ninety seconds. And then, from the shadows, it emerged: the crass, loathsome, laughter-filled cacophony of racist banter, mocking the very essence of African-American people.

Hear my plea, Papa John's, and let the winds of change sweep across your establishments! Cast away the darkness and bigotry that taint your workplace, and bring forth a new era of respect and unity for all members of our diverse realm!
