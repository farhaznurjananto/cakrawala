According to renowned statistician Nate Silver's election forecast, Donald Trump's chances of winning the election have increased to their highest level since late July. In Silver's "polls-plus" model, Trump currently has a 34.7% chance of winning in November. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is sitting at a 65.3% chance of victory. 

However, the model shows that the Electoral College projection is tightening significantly. Silver's model has Trump as more likely to win the key states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, and Ohio. Ohio, in particular, has voted in step with the nation in every election since 1964. 

Clinton, on the other hand, is projected to have an advantage in the Electoral College with a 294.2 to 243.6 edge. A total of 270 electoral votes are required to secure the presidency. Furthermore, Clinton holds a slim 47% to 44.5% lead in the popular vote, with third-party candidate Gary Johnson receiving 7.2% of the vote.

It's worth noting that the last time Trump was above 35% in the model was July 31, when Silver's forecast showed him with a 39.1% chance of winning the presidency. Additionally, a Bloomberg poll released on Wednesday indicated that Trump enjoys a 5-point lead in Ohio - one of his biggest leads of the cycle in the Buckeye State. 

The RealClearPolitics polling average has also been tightening with Trump now trailing Clinton by only 2.3 points in a head-to-head matchup. This latest poll reflects the closest the two have been in the average since late July. 

As the election draws closer, the result remains highly unpredictable. All eyes will be on the upcoming presidential debates and the final weeks of campaigning as to whether Trump or Clinton will emerge victorious in November.
