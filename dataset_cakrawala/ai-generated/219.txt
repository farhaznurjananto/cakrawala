Melba Toast: Thinly Sliced Bread with a Rich History

Melba toast is a popular dry and crispy snack known for its thin and light texture, often paired with soup, salad, or topped with melted cheese or pâté. The toast was named after the famous Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, who was known for her exceptional singing abilities. 

The toast was invented by one of Nellie's biggest fans and an accomplished chef, Auguste Escoffier, who created the toast for Nellie when she was ill and needed a simple staple to sustain her. After creating the Peach Melba dessert in her honor, Escoffier came up with the idea of the Melba toast, which would go on to become a staple in households and restaurants worldwide.

The name is believed to have originated during the 1890s when Nellie Melba was going through a tough time with her health. It is said that Escoffier made the toast for her, and it became a regular item in her diet, helping her to recover. César Ritz, a hotel proprietor, named the toast during a conversation with Escoffier, adding to its popularity.

Melba toast is made by lightly toasting slices of bread on both sides under a grill. The bread is then thinly sliced laterally, and the slices are toasted again with the untoasted sides facing the heat source, producing a crunchy texture and making it half the thickness of regular toast. As a result, it can be classified as twice-baked food, also known as rusk.

Melba toast has a rich history and is also commercially available. At one point, it was even recommended as a food that infants could chew on when teething because of its hard texture.

In France, Melba toast is known as croûtes en dentelle, which roughly translates to lacy crust. The toast gained popularity in 1925 when the Mayo brothers prescribed the "Eighteen Day Reducing Diet" to Ethel Barrymore, which included Melba toast.

In conclusion, Melba toast is a unique snack with a history that dates back to the late 19th century. Its light and crispy texture make it a perfect snack for any time of day. Whether eaten as a standalone snack or paired with soup or salad, Melba toast brings a rich flavor to the palate.
