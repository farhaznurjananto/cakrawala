When Lina Chen and Naomi Ladizinsky founded Nix Hydra four years ago, they aimed to shake up the gaming world on behalf of girls. Their company focused on creating games specifically for girls and women, and after teaching themselves how to code, they launched Egg Baby, a mobile pet game that allowed players to care for, clothe and clean an egg baby until it hatches into a surprise creature. The game was a huge success, with 14 million downloads to date, and Nix Hydra has used the money generated from Egg Baby to fund their latest venture: Egg!, a more complex mobile game that is set to be launched early this year. 

Nix Hydra has been unique in an industry that is predominantly male-driven, and Chen and Ladizinsky have been wedded to disruption from the outset. The women initially had no experience, money or connections within the tech industry yet taught themselves how to code while challenging the existing gamer stereotypes, which tend to be built around themes of aggression, machismo and violence. 

Chen and Ladizinsky's current position is the envy of many. With over $5.6m in funds from investors including Foundry Group, their launch of Egg! is hotly anticipated, with a built-in audience that eagerly awaits its arrival. Moreover, they have few like-minded competitors. 

Chen and Ladizinsky are still relatively inexperienced within the industry, and there is no doubt that their success has been a major achievement for them. Both women studied liberal arts degrees at Yale University; hence it is impressive that they have managed to break into the male-dominated tech sector without an educational background in IT. Their story serves as an inspiration to all women who wish to excel within fields traditionally associated with men.

Their offices are located in Westlake, and they employ 34 people. Out of this number, 60% are women. This flies in the face of most gaming firms that feature predominantly male employees. The offices clearly demonstrate the character of the company, with Macs and mod furnishings, and their team of free-ranging dogs: Tootles, Zelda, Moe, Rhea, and Volta. 

Foundry Group recognised that they too needed to break down stereotypes and highlight the blind spots that exist in the investment community. The company sought female entrepreneurs working on problems focused on young women. Almost immediately the company was drawn to Nix Hydra, and it wasn't long before Foundry Group agreed to fund the project. 

The success of Egg Baby has provided the means to launch Egg!, a game that is set to capitalise on the market created by its predecessor. Ladizinsky and Chen's success in disrupting the male-dominated gaming industry is a lesson to all start-ups: it demonstrates that anything is possible regardless of one's background or gender.
