 2017 forward Marek Drezai ('98) has signed for Syracuse from Slovakia. The only school he attended - Eurohopes (@Eurohopes) May 21, 2017 
 
 A 6ft 9 forward, he Dolezaj is very versatile. He can shoot  from 3's, consistently jumping to midfield and reaching the basket. Long enough to fit  in his 2-3 zone at Jim Boheim. 
 Positionally, Dolezaj has told Evan Daniels in the past that he plays with two or he plays with three and can change the game depending on what is asked of him.  
 Syracuse, Vanderbilt, Indiana, Georgia Tech and Florida have reportedly expressed interest.  
 Syracuse was the only school Drezai attended, which happened a few weeks ago.  Orange regularly show interest in foreign players, most recently in Omar Yurtsebung, who landed at NC State University last season.  
 Syracuse's interest in Marek was made public by Evan Daniels  in February. 
  SU  has a scholarship left over for next season with the late arrivals of Drezazi and Elijah Hughes.
