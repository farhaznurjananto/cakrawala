Paul Goldschmidt is one of the MLB's most feared hitters, and for good reason. If a pitcher decides to pitch him up in the strike zone, they're doing so at a high risk. A recent hot streak from Goldschmidt has been fuelled by his ability to drill pitches thrown to the spots in the upper half of the zone and above. In fact, his "chase rate" against pitches that are "up, but out of the zone" has decreased from 37 percent last season to just 27 percent this season.

Since May 6, Goldschmidt has hit six home runs off of pitches thrown to the upper half of the zone and above, whilst only swinging and missing seven times. This means that Goldschmidt is hitting .405, with a major league-best 10 home runs, when at-bats end in those pitches.

If we compare this season to last, Goldschmidt has already hit ten homers off those pitches, which is only one shy of his total number of upper-half (or above) home runs he had last season, despite receiving 625 fewer pitches. 

This season, Goldschmidt has shown a propensity to be more selective against those pitches, only going after the ones that are good for him. His "chase rate" against what we would call "up, but out of the strike zone" pitches is down to 27 percent, from 37 percent last season. But even when he goes after a bad pitch, he's still having success, doubling on an "up but out of the zone" pitch on Friday, his eighth such hit and fifth for extra bases this season.

The chart on the right shows how stark the difference is in his performance compared with 2012. Last season, he only managed five extra-base hits against those pitches. Goldschmidt is undoubtedly one to watch for the rest of the season, as he continues to dominate pitches thrown to the upper half of the zone and above.
