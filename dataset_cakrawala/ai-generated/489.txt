Authorities in Dubai have confirmed that a fire that broke out in the renowned Torch Tower in the early hours of Friday has been successfully extinguished. In a series of official statements, Dubai's media office announced that the situation had been brought under control, and that subsequent cooling operations were being conducted.

Fortunately, no casualties have been reported in connection with the incident. The fire initially began on the ninth floor of the 352-meter-high tower, and videos posted online depicted several levels of the building engulfed in flames. Completed in 2011, the Torch Tower is one of the tallest residential skyscrapers in the world, housing a total of 658 apartments.

In response to the fire, the surrounding area was cordoned off as debris and glass fell to the ground. Eyewitnesses interviewed by Gulf News reported that smoke was pervasive throughout the vicinity.

This is not the first fire to have struck the Torch Towerâ€”another occurred in 2015. In an effort to address the risk of fires in high-rise buildings, Dubai implemented stricter fire safety regulations in January 2017. These regulations were specifically designed to reduce the flammability of the exterior cladding of the city's numerous skyscrapers, a feature previously implicated in several fires.
