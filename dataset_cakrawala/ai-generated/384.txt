Monterey Bay Aquarium: Uncovering the Extraterrestrial Nature of Octopuses

It's official – octopuses are essentially aliens. A study reveals that octopuses, with their striking physical features and defining characteristics, are entirely different from any other life form. Research has shown that octopuses possess a higher level of complexity than humans, with 33,000 genes identified in their genome – more than any other known animal.

Dr Clifton Ragsdale, a US-based researcher from the University of Chicago, said, "The octopus appears to be utterly different from all other animals, even other molluscs, with its eight prehensile arms, its large brain, and its clever problem-solving abilities. The late British zoologist Martin Wells said the octopus is an alien. In this sense, then, our paper describes the first sequenced genome from an alien."

The unusual physical features of the octopuses are worthy of science fiction films. These creatures are prevalent in all oceans and at almost all depths. They possess a range of features that call to mind sci-fi aliens. These include prehensile sucker-lined tentacles, highly mobile, camera-like eyes, sophisticated camouflage systems that alter skin colour and patterns, jet-propulsion, three hearts, and the ability to regenerate severed limbs. Scientists estimate that the two-spot octopus genome contains 2.7 billion base pairs – the chemical units of DNA – with long stretches of repeated sequences.

In short, the octopus is an intriguing life form that has recently been uncovered to contain genetic complexity beyond human understanding. Its unusual features have become a fascination to scientists worldwide. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is one such institution, passionate about preserving and showcasing these remarkable creatures – and rightly so, for what else do we know out there in the vastly unexplored depths than these appropriately named aliens of the deep seas?
