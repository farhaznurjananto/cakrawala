Donald Trump Inches Closer to GOP Nomination with Connecticut Primary Win

On Tuesday, Donald Trump won the Republican presidential primary in Connecticut, propelling him closer to victory in the Northeast and bringing him one step closer to the GOP nomination. With the majority of precincts reporting, Donald Trump received 59% of the vote, followed by Ohio Governor John Kasich at 27%, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz at 12%.

The former reality TV star had been relying on Connecticut to keep his hopes of securing a majority of delegates alive, as he also swept the rest of his Tuesday primary contests, winning in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Trump now has 996 delegates going into next Tuesday's contests; he needs 1,237 to secure the GOP nomination on the first ballot at the convention.

Connecticut, which awards 28 delegates in total, provides 13 statewide delegates outright to any candidate who receives more than 50% of the vote. It also awards three delegates to the winners of each of its five congressional districts. Since the state's congressional districts are demographically similar, candidates who perform well statewide often also win in each of the districts.

Kasich and Cruz have no realistic hope of securing the majority of delegates before the Republican convention. Their only chance is to wrest the nomination from Trump at a contested convention, which is becoming increasingly unlikely with each Trump victory.

Trump's Connecticut triumph was not a surprise, as he dominated the primaries in neighboring New York and Massachusetts, and was expected to do well in Rhode Island, which also held its primary on Tuesday. The only four polls of Connecticut this month all showed him with a comfortable lead of 20 or more points.

As the race for the GOP nomination continues, it is becoming increasingly clear that any candidate who hopes to win the nomination will have to defeat Donald Trump and his loyal supporters. This places a great deal of pressure on the remaining candidates, as they must now consider their strategy in the battle for the Republican nomination.
