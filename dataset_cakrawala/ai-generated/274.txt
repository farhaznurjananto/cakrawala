Spanish woman registers ownership of the sun and wants to impose a fee on everyone for its use

A woman from the Galicia region of Spain, Angeles Duran, has registered the sun as her property with a local notary public, according to the online edition of daily El Mundo. Duran, 49, took the step after reading about an American man who had registered himself as the owner of the moon and most planets in the solar system. She claims that there is no international agreement that prevents an individual claiming ownership of a star. The document issued by the notary public states that Duran is the “owner of the Sun, a star of spectral type G2, located in the center of the solar system, located at an average distance from Earth of about 149,600,000 kilometers.”

Duran, who lives in the town of Salvaterra do Mino, intends to impose a fee on everyone who uses the sun and wishes to give half of the proceeds to the Spanish government and 20% to the nation’s pension fund. She also plans to dedicate 10% each to research and ending world hunger, with the remaining 10% being retained by herself. She argues that if there are ideas that could generate income and improve the economy and people’s well-being, then they should be pursued.

The legality of Duran’s claim is questionable as notary documents do not enjoy full legal recognition under Spanish law, and international space law recognises only the rights of states and not individuals.
