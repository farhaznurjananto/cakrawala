 Hiya guys! I have been looking forward to sharing these swatches since around Spring break, but again this was one of my posts that had to be delayed due to health issues. Woo... *insert sarcasm* But it's finally time to share my swatches for theby Tux Polish !

In today's review I will only be showing the five creme shades that have been making us polish girls drool for weeks. Let's go ahead and get started.Theby Tux Polish will be releasing tomorrow Friday, April 22nd at 8 a.m EST. Each full-size varnish (10 ml) costs 9-10 dollars. The collection is sold as a whole (12 varnishes), individually and in sets. You could call it a pastel neon cream. However, I'd like to point out that it looks more neon in direct sunlight. The formula is really opaque and applied smoothly. I was surprised by how fast the drying time was, and this goes for all creams. After drying, the varnish naturally becomes semi-matte. It is presented in two coats and a top. You can call it a pastel neon pink cream. Hello Barbie! Seriously, if she did it herself, she couldn't be bigger than Barbie. and with everyone
