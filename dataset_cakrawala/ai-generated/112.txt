Tumiki Fighters is a side-scrolling shooter with a unique and innovative style of play. In the game, the player controls a ship made of parts that have all been salvaged from other ships. The ship can be customized by adding and removing parts, and the player can also use the parts to create new ships.

The gameplay in Tumiki Fighters is based on the concept of "tetris-style" shooting, where the player must shoot at enemies and then use the resulting debris to build up their ship. The ship can be customized to a great degree, and the player can also create new ships from scratch. The game is very challenging, and the player must use their ship wisely to defeat the enemy.
