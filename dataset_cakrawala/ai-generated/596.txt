Can Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, a woman who enjoys hunting and is against abortion rights, appeal to American women and help secure the White House for John McCain? As Palin prepares to accept the Republican Party's nomination as its first female candidate for vice president, these questions arise.

As someone who appeals to the conservative Christian base of the Republican Party, Palin may help attract both men and women to vote for McCain in the November 4 election. Opinion polls show a tight race with Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, who typically has more support from women voters than McCain.

There are two primary categories of female votes at stake: independent or undecided white women and those who backed Hillary Clinton in her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination. Ideology, particularly concerning abortion rights, which a majority of US women support, may deter many Clinton supporters from voting Republican.

Analysts at the Pew Research Center believe that most women who supported Hillary Clinton are unlikely to find a strongly pro-life Republican woman like Palin to be a desirable alternative. However, two women interviewed outside the Republican National Convention admitted to considering the McCain ticket because of Palin.

Despite these challenges, McCain's campaign hopes to win over undecided and independent women. A Gallup daily tracking poll in August showed that among independent white registered voters, 51% of men preferred McCain and 35% Obama. Among women, McCain's lead narrows, with 42% in favor of McCain and 41% for Obama. However, Palin's position on abortion rights could create difficulties in winning over these undecided female voters.

Analysts will be closely monitoring poll results in the following weeks to determine if Palin is successful in swaying the undecided female voters. Palin's personal story as a working mother of five, with an unmarried daughter experiencing a teenage pregnancy, may resonate with many US women. As future voters evaluate their candidate options, the impact of Palin's inclusion in the McCain ticket will be carefully observed.
