The vulnerable desert tortoise has faced numerous challenges in the Southwest region of the United States for decades. To protect the species, developers have taken measures to ensure their safety, even establishing the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center, a sprawling reserve outside Las Vegas. However, federal funds for the facility are running out, leading to the plan of euthanizing hundreds of the tortoises in order to close the site.

The conservation center was initially funded by fees imposed on developers who disturbed tortoise habitats on public land. As the housing market in southern Nevada grew in the 2000s, the budget for the tortoise reserve also increased. However, with the economic recession, the housing market shrank, and partners struggled to meet the center's $1 million annual budget.

Now, scientists at the conservation center are tasked with examining tortoises for signs of disease to determine which ones are healthy enough to be released into the wild. Sadly, more than half of the resident tortoises are expected to be euthanized before the center's closure at the end of 2014.

Desert tortoises have existed in the Southwest for over 200 million years but protecting those in southern Nevada has become increasingly difficult due to their slow adaptation to ever-expanding developments. Currently, their habitat spans across parts of Utah, California, Arizona, and Nevada, with an estimated population of no more than 100,000 tortoises remaining.

While the loss of the conservation center poses a threat to the already endangered species, researchers like Roy Averill-Murray, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's desert tortoise recovery coordinator, continue to search for alternative funding sources in hopes of saving at least the research function of the center.
