Growing up with a parent who played professional hockey can have a profound impact on a young player's development. For three up-and-coming OHL prospects — Tyler Bertuzzi, Nathan Staios, and Cayden Primeau — their fathers have provided a front-row seat to the high-performance world of the NHL.

Bertuzzi, the son of power forward Todd Bertuzzi, shares his dad's imposing physical presence on the ice. He also had the unique opportunity to frequent NHL dressing rooms and observe Red Wings practices. "I got to see what it takes to be an NHL player, the high performance and how he acts on and off the ice," says the 16-year-old centre. "I saw what he did day to day, and that will help me in the long run in my career."

Meanwhile, Staios furthered his hockey education by living with up-and-coming NHL stars such as Sam Gagner, Tom Gilbert, and Andrew Cogliano, who boarded with the family while Staios' father played for the Oilers. "I got to learn from them," says the defenseman. "I know how to train in the off-season and all the work I have to put in."

Primeau, the third prospect interviewed, is the son of former NHL goalie Wayne Primeau. Despite the pressure that comes with bearing a famous last name, the younger Primeau remains focused on his individual path. "My dad is my dad and I'm me, and I play my game," notes the 16-year-old netminder.

All three young prospects also enjoy strong relationships with their hockey-playing fathers, who provide vital support on and off the rink. "We're really close," says Staios of his dad. "He drives me to games and gives me good advice. He's not too hard on me. He's understanding of what I have to do to get to the next level and supports me."

Ultimately, these young men are well-situated to carve their own paths in the sport, backed by the invaluable knowledge and resources that come from growing up around NHL stars.
