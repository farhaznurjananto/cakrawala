The 28-year-old joined Madrid from Deportivo in 2010 and has made over 100  appearances for Coruna. Now, he's part of Diego Simeone's Atlético squad, which is taking La Liga by storm  after winning the Copa del Rey with a historic victory over arch-rivals Real Madrid last May. 
 However, the Brazilian was allowed to start his business at Stamford Bridge instead after  the Blues admitted they were interested in his services in the summer of 2009. 
 In an exclusive interview with FourFourTwo, Filipe Luis said: "I had a lot of offers in the Premier League, especially when I was at Deportivo. I  was in talks with Barcelona and with Atlético it was my priority, so I had to give up Chelsea. Chelsea bought the player for £15m, and it reminds me of Yuri Zhirkov." 
 
 Louis' decision paid off. Vicente Calderón's team had a great start to the 2013/14 season, winning 11 of their first 12 matches in La Liga. 
 The Brazilian  has no plans to leave Madrid anytime soon, but the former Figueirense defender "dreams" of ending his career at Ajax, where he spent the 2004/05 season on loan after leaving his home country. 
 “I am very happy at Atlético and I want to fulfill my contract until 2017. “By then I will be 31 years old. It's hard to find a good team at that age. However, I do not reject a transfer to the Italian league. 
 “But my dream is to finish my career at Ajax. I feel like I owe them because they gave me everything and I gave nothing.
