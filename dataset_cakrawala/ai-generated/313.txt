President Duterte’s propensity for making rape jokes to a significant public is continually escalating. After being scolded and criticized about this insensitive behavior towards the people’s dignity in the past, he makes another one aimed at Miss Universe candidates. 

At a tourism event in Davao City just after the Philippines had successfully hosted the Miss Universe beauty pageant, Duterte was recorded as saying: “What I don’t like are kids [being raped,] You can mess with, maybe a Miss Universe. Maybe I will congratulate you for having the balls to rape somebody when you know you’re going to die.”

This was a disturbing comment, with the added shock of President Duterte making it so soon after the Philippines had hosted a successful Miss Universe event. However, the most reprehensible part of the statement was when he said, “Having the balls to rape somebody when you know you’re going to die.” This isn’t just an absurd statement; it is insensitive to society’s sensibilities and disrespectful for a president to make such comments.

A man worthy of applause should respect women and not see them as objects. Those who nobly fight for their country and its people, who willingly put aside their machismo and ego, should be praised. Duterte congratulating someone for having the courage to rape is plain sickening, and highlight a lack of understanding for how damaging or harmful rape and sexual assault are.

It's time for President Duterte to understand that rape is plainly inappropriate, and that he should not make flippant, insensitive remarks about such a critically destructive act. Duterte should be promoting a culture that respects women and girls, one that jails rapists and those that commit crimes against them.

To make matters worse, this sort of behavior only reinforces rape culture, making it challenging for victims to speak about their experiences or come forward to report it. When the role-models of a country view and present rape in such an insensitive way, is it any surprise when rapists go unpunished, and justice becomes difficult? 

If we, as a society, expect to end this scourge on humanity, then we must confront it, and we must approach it with the seriousness that it deserves. We must eliminate any semblance of rape culture, and that starts with our leaders. Duterte should know that joking about rape is not acceptable, and that he owes a profound apology to the people of the Philippines for making such insensitive jokes.
