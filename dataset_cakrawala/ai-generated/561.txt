Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has pledged to build a new coal-fired power station in Queensland, but only if Liberal National Party leader Tim Nicholls wins the forthcoming state election. Turnbull's visit to Queensland came just after opposition leader Bill Shorten's two-day trip, in which he promoted Labor's $1bn tourism plan. Winning Queensland is considered vital for both major political parties, as 11 federal electorates are up for grabs. However, the ruling Labor Party faces challenges, such as boundary changes, the resurgence of One Nation, and the introduction of compulsory preferential voting, which could make it difficult to secure the 47 seats required for a majority in the unicameral parliament.
