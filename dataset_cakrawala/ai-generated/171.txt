Already battling air pollution, Chinese authorities are scrambling to deal with a new environmental threat: a giant island of trash floating in the East China Sea.

The island is made up of about 3,000 tons of trash and debris that has been swept together by ocean currents and deposited in the middle of the ocean, about 620 miles off the Chinese coastline, the Associated Press reports.

Although the island is far from Chinese shores, it poses a threat to the country’s marine environment.

“The floating garbage island is not only China’s problem, but a problem for the entire world’s oceans,” Liu Hongbin, vice director of the State Oceanic Administration, told state-run news agency Xinhua.

The state oceanic agency has sent a team to the area to determine how to deal with the situation, the Associated Press reports.

China has also asked South Korea and Japan to help with the cleanup, but has not received any response yet, Liu told Xinhua.

This may be the first time a floating garbage island has been observed in Chinese waters, but it’s not the first time it has been spotted in the world’s oceans.

In 1997, a floating island of trash was discovered off the coast of the Philippines. The island, which was about the size of Rhode Island, was made up of about 170,000 pieces of plastic and other debris.

The island was eventually removed by a team of volunteers using a combination of boats, helicopters, and bulldozers.

Although the floating island of trash in the East China Sea is small by comparison, it demonstrates the increasing problem of ocean pollution.

Ocean pollution is caused by a number of factors, including industrial emissions, shipping accidents, and the dumping of waste.

The problem of ocean pollution is growing increasingly important, as the world’s oceans are becoming increasingly polluted.

In 2015, the World Health Organization declared ocean pollution a “major public health threat.”

The WHO estimates that ocean pollution is responsible for killing about 250,000 people every year.

Although the floating island of trash in the East China Sea is small by comparison, it underscores the need to address the problem of ocean pollution.

In addition to cleaning up the floating island of trash, China needs to develop better policies to address the sources of ocean pollution.

China is a leading industrial nation, and its pollution problems are likely to have
