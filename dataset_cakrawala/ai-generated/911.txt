The South Pole Telescope (SPT) has detected tiny fluctuations in cosmic background radiation known as B-mode polarization. The team's findings are described in their paper, which has been uploaded to the preprint server arXiv. Scientists believe that about 500,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe began to transition from a state of plasma and energy to one in which temperatures dropped to the point where the universe became transparent enough for light to pass through. This light is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and it can still be seen today. Cosmologists studying it have used it as the foundation for a theory known as inflation, which proposes that the universe came to exist as it does today as a result of a very rapid expansion just after the Big Bang. Scientists have been studying minute fluctuations in the temperature of the CMBthey revel fluctuations in the density of the early universe to prove that the inflation theory is correct. They also study fluctuations in the polarization of the CMB, which is thought to be caused by the energy of the Big Bang scattering radiation throughout the universe. For a long time, polarization fluctuations were merely theory, but in 2002, they were observed, lending credence to inflation theory. These fluctuations were dubbed E-mode polarizations. Theory also suggests that there are subtle B-mode fluctuations in polarization, which are thought to describe the rotation of CMB polarization. Finding evidence of them has been extremely difficult, as they exist in the CMB temperature distribution as one part in ten million. But it appears that the SPT team has done just that, lending credence to the inflation theory. According to the researchers, they were able to detect E-mode polarization due to advancements in detector technology. Of course, adding credibility isn't the same as finding proof of a theory, which is why scientists believe detecting E-mode polarizations is critical. Many believe it will eventually lead to the detection of primordial gravitational waves, which theory suggests should have occurred as a result of the force of inflation. If they are discovered, the theory of inflation will most likely become the accepted theory of the universe's early formation.
