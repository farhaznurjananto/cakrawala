In a recent interview with the Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, President Barack Obama reportedly called Iran a "state sponsor of terrorism." This strong statement comes amid ongoing negotiations between top Western officials and Iran over the country's nuclear program.

During the interview, President Obama expressed deep concerns about Iran's activities in the Middle East, specifically addressing its support for violent proxies operating within other nations. He listed various instances of Iran's intervention across the region, such as supporting the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Despite these concerns, the United States is actively pursuing a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran, with a target deadline set for June 30. Critics argue that such a deal could inadvertently strengthen Iran's regional power and increase tensions between nations in the Middle East. In response, Obama acknowledged that he doesn't anticipate a nuclear deal to change Iran's aggressive stance immediately. However, he also believed that successfully addressing the nuclear issue and providing sanctions relief could potentially open up new economic opportunities for the Iranian people, thereby empowering moderate leaders within Iran.

It's important to note that the ongoing negotiations with Iran have caused strains in the relationships between the United States and its traditional Gulf allies, such as Saudi Arabia. This tension was recently highlighted by King Salman of Saudi Arabia's decision to withdraw from a summit hosted by President Obama, which indicates heightened concerns amongst US allies in the region. In light of these developments, securing a successful and balanced nuclear deal with Iran will be crucial in maintaining stability and diplomatic relations across the Middle East.
