Exploring Crater Lake: A Guide for Hikers and Fisherman

Located in Alpine County, California, Crater Lake is a serene and picturesque destination for hikers and fishermen alike. The lake is situated off of Highway 88 near Carson Pass and can be reached by traveling down the unmarked Alpine Mine Road. While a wilderness permit is not required for this area, visitors must obtain a fire permit to light campfires. The road leading to Crater Lake is not maintained and can only be approached in non-4WD vehicles for the first few hundred yards. Parking is available past the gate which is about 50 yards from the highway. 

The hike uphill towards the lake is mild but requires some endurance. The trail is an old road that winds halfway up the mountain before splitting into two roads. Upon reaching the split, hikers are advised to stay to the left on road 31091. The right road leads across the creek to several old mines on the hillside, so it is important to avoid this path. If you have crossed any creeks during your hike, you have missed the turn. Continue on for another mile to reach your destination. It is worth noting that the trail includes some snow fields which require good footholds to cross as they lie on steep banks.

Once you reach the lake, you can enjoy fishing right away. In mid-May, during ice-out, the lake can cost a bit more difficulty while fisherman fish for the small Eastern Brook Trout. The difficulty stems from the significant inversion due to thermocline. While a few fish may be found foraging at the surface, most are deep, held towards the bottom of the lake. The depth of the lake makes it tough to locate fish, but fishermen had luck using dry flies like Humpys with a slow, almost motionless retrieve. They also had success with powerbait of various colors, with some even citing the effectiveness of green powerbait. In contrast, spinners and kastmasters did not yield much luck. The fish are not likely to expend too much energy while the water temperature is near freezing.

Campers can choose from several campsites around the lake. The best campsites are located on the eastern side of the lake, though the wind can be strong there. The western side of the lake is another option and can be reached after crossing the outlet creek and a treacherous snow patch on the northwestern shore. While the fishing is located on the west side, the ice covering the entire eastern side may limit camping availability. 

In conclusion, Crater Lake is a special destination that should be cherished and respected. While it requires a bit of work to get there, the experience is incomparable. Hikers and fishermen will love the quiet serenity that can be found around the lake; however, visitors must ensure that they follow all guidelines and regulations to preserve the natural beauty of the area.
