Porn is a rather uncomfortable subject for most people. One thing that often accompanies watching porn and can be especially embarrassing is masturbation. And now a new issue has arisen around porn and masturbation in the form of pornographic erectile dysfunction.  
 But wait a minute, aren't only older men suffering from erectile dysfunction? Yes, this is generally true, although men of all ages can experience this problem. However, porn-induced erectile dysfunction is a new problem, different from the usual erectile dysfunction, and it affects men of all ages.  
 Obviously, not being able to get an erection is a physical problem, but a number of factors, including medical or physical problems, as well as mental and emotional problems, can cause this condition. . Here are some of the most common causes: high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes; certain prescription drugs, alcohol and drug use, smoking; depression, stress and anxiety, anger; overweight, self-image, low sex drive. The list seems exhaustive but the hardest thing  to see in any description of the causes of erectile dysfunction is pornography.
