Margaret Thatcher's infamous claim that there's no such thing as society is a point of contention for the left. In similar fashion, David Cameron could provoke right-wing sensitivity by declaring that "the market" doesn't exist. The market has been portrayed as a significant player in recent events, with people saying that it dislikes uncertainty, coalition government, and waiting.

Television news crews have even gone to the City of London in an attempt to find this mysterious creature, standing outside empty office buildings hoping to catch a glimpse of it. In reality, the situation is much more complex. There are numerous markets, each with their own buyers and sellers expressing various opinions on future developments.

Some markets have demonstrated clear reactions to political volatility. For example, the foreign exchange market has seen the value of sterling fluctuating in relation to Labour's fortunes. The pound's value fell against the dollar when it appeared likely that Gordon Brown's departure could result in a deal with the Liberal Democrats, only to rise once more when this possibility faded in favor of a Tory-led coalition.

Government debt, or gilts, also experienced significant fluctuations. However, speculation that this could be the beginning of a long-dreaded "strike" by disappointed investors proved unfounded, as a regular government debt auction during the peak of the political turmoil was oversubscribed by a factor of two.

Despite the drama, the overall change in the market has been relatively small. Sterling's value has returned to its position from Friday, and the FTSE 100 was more affected by global economic conditions than by domestic politics. However, it is crucial not to underestimate the importance of financial markets. Rating agencies, hedge funds, and other players cannot be ignored, as their actions have significant consequences for the global economy.

The new government will have to manage a challenging balancing act over the coming years, raising approximately Â£167 billion in debt each year without harming the economic recovery, continuing the progress made by the Labour government in addressing the broken financial system. This is an essential task, as maintaining investor confidence in the UK's public finances and promoting investment in UK businesses is crucial.

The Liberal Democrats and Vince Cable have recognized the need for radical change, and their negotiations with the Tories on financial reform will have significant consequences. Reforms to party funding, breaking up banks, and avoiding drastic cuts to the deficit can all help to foster a more mature relationship with the world of finance. The market is neither a natural force nor an unstoppable monster; it is a human creation that we must learn to control and navigate effectively.
