In a recent interview with News Real Blog, Rep. Ron Paul shared his views on America's Israel policy, and his attitude towards the Jewish state was particularly prominent. Paul argued that Israel is under threat as America is always there, and their policies only impose greater threats upon them. Since they expect U.S. intervention if they do not follow their regulations, the congressman believes that they consider America more of a threat than any military power. Moreover, with 300 nuclear weapons, Israel is a virtually untouchable power. 

It seems evident from the interview that the congressman's comments on the matter were somewhat ignorant. In fact, he believes that the U.S. should treat all countries equally and be friends with all of them. However, it is unlikely that this will be accepted as a viable strategy to voters. For instance, treating Canada the same way as North Korea would not help the U.S. gain any political advantage. 

Furthermore, most Americans do not agree with Rep. Paul's view on the Israel issue. According to a Gallup poll released the other day, more than four times as many U.S. citizens prefer Israel over Palestine. Conservatives, in particular, offer enhanced support for Israel; this does not bode well for Paul's likelihood to win the Republican Primary in 2012. 

In short, while Rep. Paul may have certain views about U.S. foreign policy that sound noble, it is doubtful whether they will gain much support amongst the masses. In any case, it is important to take all factors into account before deciding on a particular foreign policy.
