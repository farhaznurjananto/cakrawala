Smoking is back in pubs, Neil. Smoking is back in pubs.

That's right, Neil. Smoking is now allowed in pubs in England and Wales.

The UK's Department of Health announced on Monday that it has lifted the ban on smoking in pubs and clubs, as long as the smoking areas are well-ventilated and separately enclosed from other areas of the pub.

The department said that it is working with the pub and club industry to make sure that these areas are properly designed and managed.

The decision was made after public consultation found that a majority of people support the lifting of the ban.

Neil warned that this is just the start of the tobacco industry's campaign to re-normalize smoking.

"This is just the start of the tobacco industry's campaign to re-normalize smoking," Neil said. "They're trying to get people to believe that smoking is not as bad as people think it is."

Neil called on the government to take a stronger stance against the tobacco industry.

"The government needs to take a stronger stance against the tobacco industry," Neil said. "They need to make it clear that smoking is not acceptable in any public place. We need to protect our children from the harm that smoking can cause."
