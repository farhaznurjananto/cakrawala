The Petrobras scandal that shocked Brazil has started to reverberate around the globe, as US authorities crack down on alleged corruption involving international firms. A $3.5bn settlement, the largest ever under America's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, was agreed upon on December 21, between the US Department of Justice and Brazil's largest builder Odebrecht, along with petrochemical joint venture Braskem. The DoJ unearthed illicit dealings involving a staggering $788m in bribes linked to officials and political parties across North and South America, and as far afield as Africa. With these explosive revelations, it now falls into the hands of each implicated country to take action against the individuals accused of cashing in on corruption.
