Uber Technologies Inc. has agreed to settle a lawsuit with one of its major investors for $148 million after the two clashed over money-losing bets on an electric-scooter startup.

The settlement with early investor Benchmark Capital was announced quietly on Friday, with a court filing that said the deal would “resolve all outstanding claims” between the two sides.

Benchmark Capital had invested $258 million in Uber in 2013 and was one of the earliest investors in the ride-hailing company. But the two clashed over the company’s investment in electric-scooter startup Lime, with Benchmark Capital urging Uber to sell its stake and focus on its core business.

Uber’s shares fell by as much as 80% after the company announced its decision to sell its stake in Lime in December 2017. The company later said the decision to sell its stake was made in the face of mounting losses and declining ridership.

The settlement will see Benchmark Capital receive $148 million in cash and shares worth about $48 million. The remaining $112 million will be paid out in a series of payments over the next three years.

The settlement comes as Uber continues to face a number of legal challenges. Last month, the company agreed to pay $148 million to settle charges of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at its workforce. And in June, the company agreed to pay $245 million to end a lawsuit accusing it of stealing trade secrets from Google.

The company has also been hit by a string of scandals over the past few months, including the revelation that its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, had been using an app that allowed drivers to track the location of their passengers. Kalanick was forced to step down from his role in June.
