A Guide to Getting Your Program on HBO Attendees at the "First Fridays" Q&A event held on June 3 at the Jacob Krueger Studio were able to get a glimpse behind the scenes at the executive minds of HBO. Alex Fumero, HBO's new vice president of programming, was the guest for the event. This is something that doesn't typically happen for audiences. This evening with HBO was packed to capacity with screenwriters, actors, and other creatives who were eager for insight on how to navigate the industry. The event was co-hosted and moderated by iTVFest and Executive Director Philip Gilpin, and it was put on in cooperation with Akyumen Technologies. Throughout the course of the event, which lasted for a total of two hours, Fumero underlined the significance of having a unique story and voice when selling a product. This is something that frequently requires designers to have a diverse set of skills. "The reality is that things are moving more in the direction of creators rather than simply saying 'I'm a writer' or 'I'm an actor,'" says the author of this article. Fumero said. "When I was in college, I attended theater school, and one of the things that we learned there was that the only way to be successful in the theater industry is to create your own work. It was true at the theater back then, and I believe that the same thing is very true about television now." These kinds of abilities can be found all across the web series and independent circuit (a well that Fumero was deliberately brought on to tap), but when he looked to his network, he mentioned Lena Dunham, the creator of "Girls" as well as one of the show's stars. In spite of the fact that he was quick to clarify that not all fascinating new work needed to be semi-autobiographical, he recommended that young creators focus on whatever it is that they are enthusiastic about. You should have a vision, you should have an opinion, and you should make it known how you view the world even if it requires you to be forceful about it." That's the thing about working with creatives: I would almost rather work with someone who is somewhat challenging to work with because they have such strong opinions than work with someone who is very nice but is sort of like, 'What do you want?' because that's the way I feel when I'm working with someone who is very nice but is like, 'What do you want?' "he said. "Art is violence; you have to make a choice between the two." After keeping these considerations in mind, the next step is to get your work into the hands of Fumero and the other people working with him. Fumero thinks that having an agent represent you or participating in independent festivals and incubators like iTVFest (which is sponsored by HBO) are the best ways to have your work noticed by the appropriate individuals. READ: Preparatory Steps to Take Before Signing with an Agency "I believe that you should look for platforms that provide you with the opportunity to showcase your work. This will allow individuals such as managers, agents, or production companies with a longer track record of success, as well as incubators, to view your work, partner with you, and assist you with the business side of things, so that you can reach people like me. This is the model that best represents reality "Fumero stated. "If it weren't for these kinds of attention filters, I wouldn't have the bandwidth to sift through the amount of ideas." From that point on, whenever Fumero is approached with a potential new project by an agency, the first thing he does is ask himself the following three questions: Do I like this? Do we have something that's comparable to this? And is it comparable to anything else that can be found in the market today? As Fumero described it, HBO has always been a network that places a high value on its creators and abilities, or as the network "breeds a culture of creative first." But, when it comes to the early stages of development, CEOs rely on their instincts above all else. He stated that "more than anywhere else, [HBO is] absolutely a know-it-when-I-see-it sort of firm." (Know-it-when-I-see-it type of company) "Finding particular voices, or even well-known voices that are contributing something novel, is of the utmost importance.... Other from whatever it is that you bring, I wouldn't say there is anything in particular that should be brought. In my opinion, there is no way to decipher it using the opposite method."
