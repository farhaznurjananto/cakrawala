AUGUST 31â€” In a private memo to other staff members last year, the diversity director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee outlined "best practices" for dealing with the "radical" Black Lives Matter movement. One of these practices was to avoid saying things like "all lives matter" and "black on black crime," which "anger BLM activists" and are "seen as red herring attacks." In a memo from November 2015, written by Troy Perry, it is said that the document "should not be sent by email or given to people outside the building. Please give these best practices to campaign staff only in meetings or over the phone." The Perry memo was put on the WordPress blog of "Guccifer 2.0" late on Tuesday night. "Guccifer 2.0" is the hacker who has claimed credit for breaking into the computer systems of the DCCC and the Democratic National Committee. Perry (shown above), who wrote the BLM memo, has since left the DCCC to work for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Perry said that candidates for president "have had trouble responding to BLM's tactics," so House candidates and their campaign staff "should be ready." So, Perry told his staff, "If BLM activists come up to you, meet with them and listen to what they have to say, but don't offer support for specific policy positions." Perry told Democrats to "Be a Partner and Lead From Behind" because BLM members "don't want their movement to be taken over by the Democratic Party." Under the heading "Message," the memo says, "Do not say "all lives matter" or talk about "black-on-black crime." Perry wrote that these phrases "are all seen as false flag attacks" that would draw unwanted attention from the media and "only anger BLM activists." Perry came to the conclusion, "This is the worst answer." When talking to the media and activists about BLM, Perry suggested a few talking points. "A history of systemic racism is still a part of African-Americans' daily lives," he wrote. "The country must find ways to fix this problem" and make sure that African-Americans are treated "fairly and with respect." (2 pages)
