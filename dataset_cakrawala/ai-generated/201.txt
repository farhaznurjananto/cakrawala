MLSsoccer.com Introduces New Video Host and Show

MLSsoccer.com is excited to introduce their new video host, Rachel Bonnetta, and their new show, Off Topic. The aim of this show is to offer viewers a unique perspective of Major League Soccer, highlighting some of the most exciting off-the-field stories that take place beyond the white lines.

As a Canadian MLS enthusiast, Rachel will take us on a journey all around America and Canada, giving us a chance to familiarize ourselves with different supporters, players, stadia and the overall soccer community we all belong to. We’ll be able to enjoy all this while staying updated on what’s happening in the social media world. Through her show, Rachel will give us insights into who we should follow on Twitter, Instagram, Vine, and Snapchat.

Rachel stands out in the industry due to her humorous, outgoing persona that emanates positivity and a deep passion for MLS. She has been making waves on different media platforms, including TSN, Fox Sports, and now, MLSsoccer.com.

Off Topic will explore MLS soccer by showcasing some of the lesser-known tales that often go overlooked. Rachel’s goal is to go beyond the obvious and take the viewers beyond the field. The first episode of the show features a visit to Philadelphia where Rachel gets to hang out with Maurice Edu, Union’s star midfielder, and World Cup veteran. Mo, as he likes to be referred to, spends some quality time with Rachel, sharing tips on buying sneakers (with so many pairs, it’s mind-blowing), and introducing her to the famous Philly cheesesteak.

Rachel would like your participation with the show as well. The MLS community members have the craziest stories, and she hopes that the show will be a platform to showcase these interesting and unique stories. You are encouraged to send in suggestions, what you want to see on the show, who it should feature, and where it should go. Rachel and her team are ready to pack their bags and hit the road.

Make sure not to miss Off-Topic and follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelBonnetta for all the updates about the show. Get ready for a thrilling experience as MLSsoccer.com takes us on an incredible MLS journey.
