Famitsu: Mr Kim, what interests you most in the current video game market?

Kim: It’s interesting that you bring that up because I’ve actually been thinking about this a lot lately. Nowadays, there are fewer titles that are truly “massively multiplayer” games. I think there’s an opportunity for a game that is more focused on community, that’s “massively multiplayer” in the sense of more people playing at the same time, like an MMO.

Famitsu: What do you think are the most important elements of an MMO?

Kim: I think the most important thing is that the game has to be something that people want to play together. There also has to be something that keeps people coming back.

Famitsu: What do you think about the current state of the MMO market?

Kim: I think the MMO market is in a bit of a slump. I think there are a lot of people who want to play MMOs, but there aren’t that many good ones out there.

Famitsu: What do you think is the reason for this?

Kim: I think it’s because people are just not that interested in MMOs right now. I think there are a lot of people who are looking for something different, and I think that’s why the market is shrinking.

Famitsu: What do you think needs to be done in order to revive the market?

Kim: I think that the biggest thing that needs to be done is to create new, innovative MMOs. I think that if there are new, interesting MMOs coming out, people will be more interested in playing them.

Famitsu: Mr Kim, thank you for your time.

Kim: No problem. It was great to speak with you.
