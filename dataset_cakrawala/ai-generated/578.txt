As autumn arrives with its cooler weather and the latest crop of video premieres, Boil the Ocean's blog takes a closer look at the potential candidates for Thrasher's 2011 Skater of the Year (SOTY) award. This coveted recognition holds significant weight among street skaters and does not involve large cash prizes.

Dennis Busenitz:
This might be the last opportunity for Busenitz to win the SOTY, as his chances are dwindling due to the rise of younger skaters with more impressive techniques. Despite his recent success in Tampa and his influence on the modern skate scene, it's possible that he may be overlooked once again.

Torey Pudwill:
With professional footwear, a dedicated week on Thrasher's website, and a high-profile relationship, Pudwill has made significant progress since leaving Alien Workshop. Although his online presence was immense, it remains to be seen if he can match the level of top SOTY contenders.

Grant Taylor:
Highly regarded by fellow skaters, Taylor boasts consistently impressive performances and a no-nonsense attitude. Despite not having a dedicated video part released, his raw talent and determination make him a strong contender for the title.

Brandon Westgate:
Following his impressive showing in 2010, Westgate's down-to-earth persona in "Epicly Later'd" and his success on San Francisco's hills have earned him widespread admiration. Notably, he managed to backside smith grind up a handrail, solidifying his status as a top-level skater.

Nyjah Huston:
At just 16 years old, Huston has already accumulated nearly a million dollars in competition winnings. Despite his innate talent and a recent feature in Thrasher, his tricks sometimes lack the excitement and unpredictability of other contenders.

Justin Brock:
As our wildcard candidate, Brock brings a rowdy, rebellious spirit and a memorable performance in the Real video to the table. An avid beer drinker and proud Southerner, his participation in King of the Road demonstrates his dedication to the sport and his fellow skaters.

Fred Gall:
Our controversial, dark horse pick, Gall's penchant for trouble and daring stunts have made him a divisive figure in the skate community. Comparisons to Sean Sheffey highlight their shared love for switchstance skating and legal misadventures.

As we eagerly anticipate the announcement of Thrasher's 2011 Skater of the Year, these talented athletes continue to push the boundaries of what's possible on a skateboard, leaving an indelible mark on the sport's history.
