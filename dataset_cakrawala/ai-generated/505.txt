D.C. United and Events DC officials are reportedly close to agreeing on a two-year lease extension at RFK Stadium, creating an opportunity for attempts to build a new team stadium in the District. The lease is expected to have more favorable conditions for the team as well as possible incentives to encourage them to remain in the District long-term. The improved budget situation in the city is also generating optimism.

To prevent financial losses, United officials have been looking to secure a more favorable lease. Team President Kevin Payne recently acknowledged his discussions with officials in Maryland and the District. Events DC board member, William N. Hall, stated that the new lease would be more reflective of the expenses other Major League Soccer (MLS) teams face.

The two-year extension should provide enough time for negotiations between the city, Events DC, and the team about building a new soccer stadium in D.C that accommodates both the city and D.C. United's needs. Although Gregory A. O'Dell, Events DC president and chief executive, refrained from revealing lease terms, he suggested that contingencies giving incentives for the team's long-term commitment to the District could be included.

Mayor Vincent C. Gray has maintained that the team must finance its own stadium. However, Hall and others believe Gray may assist the team in securing a deal. Despite D.C. ending its 2011 fiscal year with a $240 million surplus, Jack Evans, Council member, said the city was unable to issue bonds for the project, as it did for Nationals Park or the convention center, due to the city's borrowing limit. Hence, the team would have to borrow the funds themselves.

With the situation progressing, Hall remains confident in securing a deal to ensure D.C. United remains in Washington for the foreseeable future.
