NFL Players Searching For Painkiller Choices

Like many athletes, football players look for alternatives to painkillers. They have been linked to opioid addiction and overdose, which claimed the life of former Chicago Bears quarterback Dave Duerson.

In this week's "All Things Considered" series on pain, NPR's Melissa Block speaks with Seattle Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright about how he deals with pain. He says he tries not to use painkillers. Instead, he has a team of specialists help him with other methods, such as acupuncture and cupping.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

On this program, we're going to be talking a lot this week about pain. The federal government estimates that 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and we're going to hear from patients, from doctors and from others who are searching for solutions.

Today, we turn to football, a sport where pain is a constant. Players are routinely injured, often severely. So how do they cope? We're going to hear from K.J. Wright of the Seattle Seahawks. He's a linebacker who's been in the NFL for nine years. He's just had surgery on his left knee.

K.J. Wright, welcome to the program.

K.J. WIGHT: Thank you.

BLOCK: How do you deal with the pain?

WIGHT: Well, you know, I try not to use painkillers. I have a team of specialists that help me with other methods, like acupuncture and cupping.

BLOCK: What do you think about the opioid epidemic?

WIGHT: I think it's terrible. I mean, it's taken a lot of lives, and I think it's something that we need to address.

BLOCK: Have you been tempted to use painkillers?

WIGHT: No, I haven't.

BLOCK: Do you think that other players in the NFL are using painkillers?

WIGHT: I don't know. I haven't talked to them about it.

BLOCK: You don't think that they might?

WIGHT: I don't know. It's tough to say. I mean, you know, it's an individual thing.

BLOCK: What do you think about the NFL's efforts to address the opioid epidemic?

WIGHT: I think they're doing a good job.
