Governor Robert Bentley of Alabama made a statement on Friday evening stating that the water difficulties affecting sections of northern Alabama were "not a crisis," despite the fact that one utility advised its customers not to drink the tap water. Bentley stated in a press release, "Based on my present understanding, I am convinced that there is no health-related crisis relating to the water quality of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority." "I believe every citizen should have access to potable water." The issue surfaced on May 19, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for the man-made chemicals PFOS and PFOA, noting that lower amounts of these substances than previously believed could cause health issues over time. As a result, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority urged its consumers not to drink the water from its taps, which had been tested and found to contain amounts exceeding the new recommended threshold. Bentley stated that this decision was taken without consulting his office or other state authorities. "After consulting with the State Health Officer, Dr. Tom Miller, and the Director of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Lance LeFleur, it is clear that a local decision effectively transformed an advise into a regulation," Bentley stated. My office, along with ADPH and ADEM, was unaware of this decision's consideration prior to its announcement. Miller stated that the ADPH's health recommendation remains in effect, recommending that pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, and infants who consume formula mixed with water avoid tap water. This advisory does not advise the general public to avoid tap water." Miller explained that the EPA's health recommendation was not based on acute or time-limited exposures, but rather on lifetime exposures to perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) and perfluorooactanoic acid (PFOA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based its decisions on laboratory tests on rats and mice as well as a study of evidence from groups of persons known to have been exposed to PFOS and PFOA in certain regions of the country. The general manager of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority, Don Sims, stated that he did not wish to inform certain individuals that the water was safe and others that it was not. Sims stated, "I would rather be overcautious than undercautious." "I'm neither a doctor or a chemist, so I don't want to be the one to say 'you drink it and you don't' when they advise one group of people that the water is unsafe." So I suggested nobody drink it." LeFleur stated that ADEM would continue to collaborate with the water authorities to guarantee the safety of the drinking water. LeFleur stated, "Through a strong partnership with the Alabama Department of Public Health and federal agencies, we will continue to monitor any potential risks associated with perfluorinated chemicals in the drinking water of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority and other water systems in Alabama."
