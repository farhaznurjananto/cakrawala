It may have taken a one-two punch to kill off the dinosaurs. People often say that the dinosaurs died out because of an asteroid or comet that hit Earth 66 million years ago and was six miles wide. But it may have just started the events that will shake the world. A paper published Thursday in the journal Science suggests that the impact may have set off a huge amount of volcanic activity, which could have caused more long-term damage than the impact itself. In an interview, the study's lead author, geologist Paul Renne, said, "It's one of the biggest mysteries in the history of the planet." "How can such a large, varied, and dominant group of animals be gone forever in the blink of an eye? It is a wonderful thing." At the end of the Cretaceous period, when the K-T boundary, or K-T boundary for short, happened, all dinosaurs that weren't birds and many other species died out. Scientists have talked about what happened for a long time. Most theories say that a huge rock from space hit the Gulf of Mexico and killed everyone there. Volcanism, on the other hand, was a big idea. The Chicxulub impact crater in Mexico is about 9,000 miles from the Deccan Traps in India. The Deccan Traps are one of the largest volcanic formations on Earth. The new paper gives more accurate dates for these huge lava flows than was done before. They are the same age as Chicxulub. When they erupt, volcanoes can send out a lot of dangerous ash, lava, and gases. This is why they have been blamed for other mass extinctions. In fact, a huge eruption probably caused the mass extinction that made room for the dinosaurs about 201 million years ago. For decades, scientists have argued about what really killed off the dinosaurs. Timing is the key for Dr. Renne and his colleagues. "From what we know, an impact like the one that happened at the K-T boundary probably only happens once every billion years or so on Earth. It's not likely at all, "says Renne. "The chance that it would happen at the same time as a volcanic eruption, which is not as rare but also doesn't happen very often by chance, is really, really small." He continues, "When you have a lot of unlikely things happen at the same time, you have to consider that there might be a link between them." Something very big would have to happen to kill off all the dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and pterosaurs that lived on land, in the water, and in the air. "Most likely, really small things don't change the way life works on our planet in big ways. They are really hard to understand. It's all of these different things coming together and interacting with each other "he says. Renne says that earthquakes can cause volcanoes, so his theory just takes that and makes it bigger. "It looks like that would work if you just extrapolated the size of the volcanoes and the size of the earthquakes." The huge asteroid (or comet, which is also hotly debated) would have caused about as much seismic energy as a magnitude 11 earthquake when it hit the Earth. In 2014, Chile was the site of the largest earthquake, which had a magnitude of 8.2. The Moment Magnitude Scale is logarithmic, and every 1.0 increase in magnitude releases over 30 times as much energy, so a jump of 2.8 means the shocks would have gone back and forth through the Earth. If the asteroid or comet was big enough, it could have shaken the Earth to its core, shaking the core-mantle boundary plume that fed the already active volcanoes in India and causing the Deccan Traps to erupt with lava flows that were more than a mile thick and covered an area the size of Utah and Nevada. The lava and ash could have destroyed the area, like volcanic material did in Pompeii, and the gases that were released would have had a global effect, which Renne says would have been either a very warm or very cold event. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that got into the air could have raised the temperature of the whole planet by a few degrees. On the other hand, the sulfate aerosols could have covered up the sun, which would have cooled the Earth's temperature. Or, Renne says, maybe both events happened at slightly different times, which caused big changes in the climate. Any of these things could have happened, and all living things would have had to change or die. Renee and his colleagues suggested in April that the huge impact and the huge eruption may have worked together to cause this mass extinction. Renne says that their work to figure out how old the Deccan Traps are has backed up their theory. They found that the Deccan eruptions were getting worse and changing a lot.
