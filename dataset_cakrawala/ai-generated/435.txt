The rise of the American craft whiskey industry has led to a surge in small craft distillers buying and releasing whiskey made and aged elsewhere in order to stay afloat while their own spirits mature in barrels. While some distillers are transparent about the provenance of their whiskey, many others operate less honestly. Some whiskeys appearing on the market as craft products, have actually been sourced from MPG Ingredients (formerly Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana – LDI), including the very popular Templeton Rye. This practice, however, is not new, and many companies have a long history of buying Scotch Whisky from established suppliers, aging or blending it on their own, and disclosing the original maker of the whisky and its distillation date. When done correctly, curating and blending different whiskeys can produce truly exceptional products. High West Distillery in Park City, Utah, for example, has garnered a considerable reputation for their blends of fine whiskey. 

High West’s American Prairie Reserve is a fine example of their skillful blending of different whiskeys. Blending a six-year bourbon distilled and aged at Seagrams plant in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, with a 10-year old bourbon from Four Roses distillery, the American Prairie Reserve boasts a mashbill of 75% corn, 20% rye, and 5% barley. The Four Roses bourbon blend features 60% corn, 35% rye, and 5% barley malt. High West is commendably forthcoming about the contents of its bottle, even though the exact ratio of the different whiskeys is not revealed. Unlike many other blends, High West’s whiskey also contains distillates that are not chill-filtered. 

The American Prairie Reserve is a light amber in color, with a much younger appearance than might be expected from a blend of such mature whiskeys. The nose has a faint spice of oak, cinnamon, and caramel. Similarly, the initial taste is light and easy, with oak as the star feature. Balanced with cinnamon, vanilla, and honey flavors, there is just a hint of mid-palate spiciness, which never overwhelms the sweetness. Finally, the finish is moderate, very dry with oak spice predominating over cinnamon and honey. 

Despite the excellent blending, the High West American Prairie Reserve has one notable drawback: its price point. Costing over $40, it feels rather excessive for what it delivers in the glass, particularly as the whiskey has too dry a finish. On the other hand, the distiller is donating 10% of after-tax profits to the American Prairie Reserve, which is a laudable gesture. Ultimately, however, despite its light and easy flavor profile, the whiskey may not be worth the premium it commands.
