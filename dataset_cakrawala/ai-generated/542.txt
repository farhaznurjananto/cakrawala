In a fascinating turn of events, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who had previously likened the European Union to a Nazi-like super state, has now chastised those who dare to compare US President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Amidst a heated Commons debate on Trump's divisive immigration ban, Johnson boldly accused the UK's Labour Party of "demeaning the Holocaust" and urged MPs to put an end to the "pointless demonisation" of Trump. Interestingly, just a few weeks prior, Johnson likened French President Fran√ßois Hollande to a WWII German general, and in May 2016, he even claimed that the EU was striving to dominate Europe in the same manner as Hitler or Napoleon.
