ATLAS: A General-Purpose Particle Detector Experiment

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of seven particle detector experiments constructed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The ATLAS experiment was one of the two LHC experiments involved in the discovery of the Higgs boson, a missing piece of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, in July 2012. The experiment is designed to observe phenomena that involve highly massive particles, which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. 

The ATLAS detector is a collaboration involving roughly 3,000 physicists from over 175 institutions in 38 countries. It is 46 meters long, 25 meters in diameter, and weighs about 7,000 tonnes. The experiment has some 3000 km of cable and is designed to take advantage of the unprecedented energy available at the LHC. It was proposed in its current form in 1994 and officially funded by the CERN member countries in 1995. Construction work began at individual institutions, with detector components then being shipped to CERN and assembled in the ATLAS experiment pit, starting in the year 2003. Karl Jakobs leads the project now.

At 27 kilometers in circumference, the LHC collides two beams of protons together, with each proton carrying up to 6.5 TeV of energy - this is enough to produce particles with masses that are significantly greater than any particles currently known, if these particles exist. ATLAS is designed to detect these particles, namely, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the particle beams collide, the detector is designed in layers made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. The different traces that particles leave in each layer of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure, and stop higher-energy particles. As of 2017, ATLAS is the largest detector ever built at a particle collider.

ATLAS is a general-purpose detector. When the proton beams produced by the Large Hadron Collider interact in the center of the detector, a variety of different particles with a broad range of energies are produced. Rather than focusing on a particular physical process, ATLAS is designed to measure the broadest possible range of signals. This is intended to ensure that whatever form any new physical processes or particles might take, ATLAS will be able to detect them and measure their properties. Experiments at earlier colliders, such as the Tevatron and Large Electron-Positron Collider, were designed based on a similar philosophy. However, the unique challenges of the Large Hadron Collider, its unprecedented energy, and extremely high rate of collisions, require ATLAS to be significantly larger and more complex than previous experiments.

ATLAS investigates many different types of physics that might become detectable in the energetic collisions of the LHC. Some of these are confirmations or improved measurements of the Standard Model, while many others are possible clues for new physical theories. The detection of the Higgs boson was one of the most important goals of ATLAS. The experiments were also able to show that the properties of the particle, as well as the ways it interacts with other particles, were well-matched with those of a Higgs boson, which is expected to have spin 0 and positive parity. In March 2013, the ATLAS project and CMS, its sister experiment, were able to prove that the detected particle was indeed a Higgs boson. Analysis of more properties of the particle and data collected in 2015 and 2016 confirmed this further. 

In conclusion, ATLAS is a critical tool for scientists exploring particle physics beyond the Standard Model. With its unparalleled capacity to measure high-energy particle collisions, it continues to provide knowledge that redefines what we know about our universe.
