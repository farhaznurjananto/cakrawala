US Sends Secret Letters to Iran to Join Yemen Talks

The United States reportedly sent confidential letters to Iran to negotiate the fate of Yemen, according to Fars News Agency. Fars cited an anonymous source asserting that US Secretary of State John Kerry sent a message on 12 August to the Iranian Embassy in Muscat, via the Omani government, stating that the countries ought to launch discussions along with Russia to determine the fate of war-torn Yemen, without Saudi Arabia participating. Clearly, the letters are an attempt towards a diplomatic solution to one of the most devastating conflicts in the world that is costing numerous lives and causing untold misery to millions.

Despite the letters being sent, no response has been reported yet from the Iranian government. The source stated that Iran had not responded favorably to the letters and had not replied to this day. This is not the first time such letters have been sent, according to the same source. A similar situation occurred during the Iran-Iraq War, when the British government messaged the Iranian government, proposing to negotiate peace. It was then rejected by the late Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran at the time.

The war in Yemen, which escalated in 2015, has led to the deaths of over 233,000 people and has caused millions to flee their homes in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The United Nations (UN) has called it a “man-made humanitarian catastrophe”, and it continues to lead to the deaths of tens of thousands of people every year. The United Nations is constantly calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and urging cooperation between the countries involved.
