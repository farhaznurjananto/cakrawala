Four anticipated variants of the LG G3 smartphone model have recently been identified, all heading to the United States market. The identified variants are LG D850 for AT&T, LG-D851 for T-Mobile, LG-LS990 for Sprint, and LG VS985 for Verizon Wireless.

LG has made revisions to the User Agent (UA) Profile for the LG D855 model, with the updated profile showcasing a 1440x2560 display resolution for the device.

Another potential variant of the upcoming LG G3, carrying the model number LG-D855, has received approval from Postel, a telecommunications certification agency. Alongside this development, the LG-D855 has been referenced in an updated UA Profile on LG's official website. Key specifications from the profile include a 1440x2560 pixel resolution display, Android KitKat 4.4.2 operating system, and compatibility with both LTE and 3G networks.

Based on these findings, it is speculated that LG could plan to release the G3 (D855) sometime in June. With the LG D855 having received Postel approval on April 22, a potential launch date might fall in early June, possibly around June 6. This estimation is derived from the average timeframe of approximately 45 days between a device receiving Postel approval and its actual release to the market.

[Update]

In the company's most recent earnings report, LG has officially confirmed that they plan to introduce the LG G3 within the second quarter of this year.
