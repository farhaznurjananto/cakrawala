Picture ownership rights Stephanie Portal Casper Read was traveling alone to see his grandparents in Toulouse, France. The mother of a youngster who was removed from an aircraft at Gatwick owing to a lack of seats has demanded that EasyJet revamp its booking system. Casper Read, 15, was traveling alone to see his grandparents in France when he was forced to leave the aircraft because the identical seat had been assigned to a guy. Stephanie Portal from Worthing, West Sussex, reported that her son felt "rejected and betrayed." EasyJet has issued an apology, paid compensation, and opened an investigation. "Easier choice" "He was competing with an adult for a single seat, and the adult was becoming increasingly irate," Miss Portal explained. "I don't know if it was a random selection or if they felt Casper would be the easiest way to exit the plane, but it's incorrect." He was told to proceed to the cockpit, assuming he would be assigned another seat, but was instead removed outside the aircraft and directed to the information desk. He was left to navigate the airport on his own, with no one in departures to meet or assist him. Despite the fact that there were three more flights that day, he was placed on the latest flight and had a 10-hour wait.

A manager at EasyJet told Miss Portal that the airline overbooks its flights by up to five seats due to frequent no-shows, and that the last persons to check-in, not the last to purchase their tickets, are at risk of not receiving a seat. She stated, "The entire system requires an overhaul, and the attendants' attitude was reckless." Children should never be removed from an aircraft, and those who are should be given precedence for the following trip. "Airlines cannot bet on the possibility that passengers will not show up." "'Failure to follow procedure'" She stated that despite Casper's laid-back demeanor, he felt he had been kicked off and cheated. A representative for the airline stated, "EasyJet regrets that Casper Read's trip from London Gatwick to Toulouse on July 20 was oversold." We are investigating why he was allowed to board, as he should have been told at the gate. "EasyJet has a system in place to protect unaccompanied kids, but it was not followed in this instance."
