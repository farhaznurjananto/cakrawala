Read the methodology behind the ratings

The methodology behind the ratings is that each player is given a score out of 100 based on their performance during the season. The scoring system is designed so that the best players in the league are given the highest scores, and the worst players are given the lowest scores. The score is meant to be a measure of how well a player has performed relative to other players in the league. 
The ratings are compiled by a team of analysts who watch every game and track every player's performance. They then use their knowledge of the league and the players to come up with a score for each player. The analyst team makes its ratings available to the public on a website. 
The ratings are not meant to be a measure of how good a player is. They are simply a measure of how well a player has performed relative to other players in the league. So, for example, if a player has a rating of 100, that means they have performed better than all other players in the league by that rating. But it does not mean that the player is the best player in the league. It just means that they have performed better than all other players in the league by that rating. 
The ratings are always updated as new information becomes available. So, for example, if a player is injured and does not play in a game for a week, their rating will be updated to reflect that. The ratings are also updated when new players are added to the league and when players leave the league. So, for example, if a player is traded to a different team, their rating will be updated to reflect that.
