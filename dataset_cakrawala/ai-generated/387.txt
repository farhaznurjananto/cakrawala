On Friday, the US dollar rose to a two-week high against a range of currencies, as US economic data seemingly beat expectations and caused the markets to believe that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates more than once this year. This marks the best two-week gain for the dollar since late February.
 
Data published on Friday showed that US retail sales increased by 1.3% in April, recording its most significant rise in over a year. This has become a clear indication for analysts that the economy is gaining momentum, following its near-stall in Q1 of 2016. It is worth noting that, exclusive of automobiles, gasoline, building materials, and food services, retail sales increased by 0.9% last month after an upwardly revised 0.2% gain in March.

According to Samarjit Shankar, head of iFlow and quant strategies at BNY Mellon in Boston, the retail sales report was “likely to rekindle arguments from the hawkish camp in the ongoing debate among policymakers about why the Federal Reserve should consider maintaining its rate normalization efforts.” The dollar is quite likely to continue garnering support from the market’s interest rate expectations.

The US currency remained net bought over the past week, however, on a more modest basis, according to BNY Mellon data. Despite this recent increase, the greenback had suffered a sharp sell-off in Q1 of 2016, hitting a 16-month low. Market expectations of at least two Fed rate hikes this year had faded, amid concerns regarding a global economic slowdown and financial market turbulence.

However, some analysts have suggested that with such concerns having receded somewhat, there are now signs that the tide could be turning for the dollar. Investors, who now see a roughly 60% chance of a Fed hike taking place this year, may have pushed back their expectations too far.

In late trading, the dollar index had risen by 0.5% to 94.609, a rate it sustained in light of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rising to 95.8 this month from April’s reading of 89, indicating its highest level since June 2015. 

Worth noting, the eurozone's GDP grew by 0.5% in Q1, in a downward revision of an earlier estimate. Despite this, the euro fell; it was down 0.6% to $1.1304 whereas the Japanese yen was 0.4% weaker against the dollar at 108.60 yen per dollar, which is well clear of an 18-month low of 105.55 that was reached last week after the Bank of Japan chose to maintain monetary policy without change. 

Given the above information, we can infer that there may be a changing trend for the dollar if current conditions continue.
