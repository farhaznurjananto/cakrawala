On Monday night, Seth Meyers formally made his debut as the host of NBC's long-running "Late Night" talk show. Joining him on his first show were comedian and "Saturday Night Live" co-star Amy Poehler and Vice President Joe Biden. Meyers opened his show with an affectionate nod to his predecessor, Jimmy Fallon, before proceeding to deliver his own unique brand of comedy.

Meyers slipped in several quirky references throughout his show, including an obscure joke about Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. To switch up the format of a traditional late night talk show, Seth also debuted a new recurring bit called "Venn Diagrams," which combines two seemingly unrelated ideas to point out commonalities.

Meyers and Poehler's longstanding chemistry carried into the show, as they joked about how they were faking the chemistry they had on the "Saturday Night Live" Weekend Update desk. Vice President Biden issued a joke about making a major announcement, while Poehler and Meyers pretended to film a movie together called "Snakes on a Train."

Meyers, who left "Saturday Night Night Live" earlier this year after a decade of service, has stated that he wants to bring in guests from all walks of life, from actors to writers to politicians. The first week of guests appears to reflect this, featuring everyone from Patrick Stewart to Kanye West.

"Late Night with Seth Meyers" airs Monday through Thursday on NBC at 12:35 EST a.m. (0535 GMT).
