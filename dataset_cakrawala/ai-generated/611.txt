The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has recently filed a lawsuit that challenges Section 1201 of the United States' Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which serves to legally reinforce the technical limitations brought about by Digital Restrictions Management (DRM). Defective by Design applauds this legal action, echoing the EFF's belief that Section 1201 infringes upon the fundamental right to freedom of speech. We are hopeful that the removal of Section 1201 from US law marks the first step towards the demise of DRM.

DRM is regularly disarmed, or "circumvented," by skilled technologists who often develop tools to automate this process. When distributed to the public, these tools can neutralize DRM on a massive scale. Threatened by this potential loss of power, the media lobby and its political allies have established anti-circumvention laws, such as Section 1201 and similar legislation worldwide, to criminalize DRM circumvention and the sharing of relevant tools. Since the 1990s, these laws have served to sustain DRM. The hope is that, once Section 1201 is abolished, circumvention tools will become widely available, making it increasingly difficult for companies to impose DRM restrictions, ultimately leading them to abandon such efforts. To truly achieve this outcome, however, people worldwide must follow the EFF's lead and work to eradicate anti-circumvention legislation within their own countries.

As scrutiny of Section 1201 intensifies, it is crucial to recognize that the elimination of anti-circumvention laws represents only a stepping stone towards abolishing the injustices perpetuated by DRM. Even in the absence of legal enforcement, DRM undermines and demeans users by turning their devices against them. All of its detrimental effects—compromised security, limited accessibility for individuals with disabilities, remote media deletions, incompatibilities with free software, and more—will persist after the fall of anti-circumvention laws, albeit in a weakened form that is easier for users to sidestep. In the long term, in order for individuals to fully exercise their digital rights, every user must possess complete control over everything operating on their devices, extending to the source code.

Both Defective by Design and our parent organization, the Free Software Foundation, actively engage in the fight against anti-circumvention laws. We have relentlessly petitioned the US government to repeal Section 1201, supporting all proposed exemptions to the legislation and personally visiting the Copyright Office to submit public commentary, which we have collected from the anti-DRM community. We will remain vigilant for future opportunities for the Defective by Design community to support the EFF in their ongoing battle to eliminate Section 1201. In the meantime, we invite you to participate in our advocacy campaigns against DRM through our action area.
