Lee Bains III is no stranger to the Birmingham music scene having performed at a plethora of venues throughout the city with his band The Glory Fires as well as previous projects.

Ahead of the event, Lee recently spoke about the band’s activities since their 2014 record "Dereconstructed" and what fans can expect from the upcoming album.

Regarding the band’s summer, Lee explained that they will take it easy as far as touring goes for a while. Instead, they will focus their attention on writing new songs and figuring out how to parlay them into a full-band arrangement.

The band’s first two albums span across the spectrum from mellow songs to full-throttle rock. In response to what fans can expect from their new album, Lee noted that he is letting the songs take their unique path to see how they play out.

Reflecting on his adolescence through his early 20s, Lee explains how he grew energised by music at that time, which is now informing their new tracks.

Most excitingly, the band plans to perform some of their new material at the Sloss Fest this weekend. When asked about his expectations for the festival and whether it will emulate the fantastic cross-section of Birgmingham that City Stages did, Lee explained the difficulties of the previous festival over the past few years. However, he believes that Sloss Fest has the potential to become Birmingham's new festival for the residents, where they can come together in a single cross-sectional experience.

Overall, the festival is set to be incredible for all who attend, with a varied combination of arts, food, drinks, and music. Lee Bains III & The Glory Fires look forward to rock the stage with their fantastic performance, which promises to be a celebration of Birmingham’s music scene.
