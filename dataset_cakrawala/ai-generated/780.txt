more-in Two young Bidar men have created the Bidar App, a multi-utility portal that will allow city residents to access services provided by public and private agencies and businesses. "It is more than just an online phone book. It is a bundled service provider "Sheikh Atif Ashar, the company's founder, is a computer engineer who left a job in an IT firm to return to his hometown of Bidar. Akash Dasari, who is still in engineering school, is a co-founder. They are currently working on a mobile application based on the portal. They are also expanding the data on the portal to include information from throughout the district, including taluk headquarters. "Users will be able to order food online or find workers like plumbers or carpenters," says Atif. They are successfully running a door delivery project by partnering with a supermarket. While the portal remains free for users, the founders intend to charge fees to businesses that wish to be listed on the site. The portal contains information on all city government departments and important officials. Users can see the addresses and phone numbers of officers from the deputy commissioner's office, the police department, the city municipal council, the zilla panchayat, the Teheshildar office, the RTO, and other important offices. The portal also contains a wealth of information about private businesses in the city, such as shops, eateries, and food outlets with takeout, garages and mechanics, electricians, provision stores, plumbers, carpenters, and other professionals. It includes a list of schools and colleges, as well as contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Engineers, doctors, lawyers, tutors, and sports coaches all have some space set aside for their bio data. "We will have a section where users can rate all of the services. This feedback will be beneficial to future users "Akash says. Aside from the listings, the site has an extensive search option that finds phone numbers based on letters, words, or phrases entered by users. "We built the site using advanced software tools," Akash explained. To handle customer inquiries, the engineers have assembled a ten-person team. "We've been updating the information for over a year. We do not rely on information obtained from websites. We visit each business, meet the owner, and obtain his contact information. In the future, we will also provide business-to-business connections and assist entrepreneurs in collaborating. We hope to approach some investors and raise some funds "Mr. Atif stated.
