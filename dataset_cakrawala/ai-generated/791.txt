unknown The Justice Department is funding an unusual national training program to assist police officers in dealing with an increasing number of volatile encounters involving highly trained and often heavily armed combat veterans. "We just can't use the blazing-guns approach anymore when dealing with disturbed individuals who are highly trained in all kinds of tactical operations, including guerrilla warfare," said Dennis Cusick, executive director of the Upper Midwest Community Policing Institute, of the pilot program, which will be launched in 15 U.S. sites this year. "That goes beyond SWAT team experience." Cusick, who is co-developing the program with institute training director William Micklus, believes that by immediately engaging suspects in discussions about their military experience rather than using force, local authorities have a better chance of defusing violent confrontations. The goal, according to Micklus, is to reconnect them with "a sense of integrity" that has been lost in the fog of emotional distress. "You can't win by out-combatting them," Cusick said. "You emphasize to people who are now feeling out of control what it means to be a Marine, a soldier." There is no data that specifically tracks police encounters with suspects who are currently or were previously associated with the military. However, according to an Army report released this year, violent felonies in the military increased by 1% between 2010 and 2011, while non-violent felonies increased by 11%. During that time, however, crime in much of the country fell. "What we're seeing is that the volume (of violent incidents involving military personnel off base) has reached unprecedented levels," Cusick said. Much of the anecdotal evidence resembles the report of the Jan. 13 standoff between Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Eisenhauer, 30, a veteran of multiple combat tours, and police and firefighters in Fayetteville, N.C. According to a 911 call from the apartment complex manager, Eisenhauer was allegedly barricaded inside one of the apartments and exchanging gunfire with police. The suspect was not identified as a soldier, but the apartment manager told a police dispatcher that he was "under psychiatric care," according to the 911 call. According to Fort Bragg records, Eisenhauer had been assigned to the post's Warrior Transition Battalion, a unit for soldiers who have been wounded or suffered other illnesses as a result of their deployment, Womack Army Medical Center spokeswoman Shannon Lynch said. Eisenhauer, who was injured along with two police officers during the standoff, is charged with 30 criminal counts, including 15 counts of attempted murder. Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities (Police) Chiefs Association, believes the Justice Department's proposed training is inadequate "dealing with an increasing number of mentally ill suspects. "This has been a challenge in our communities for a number of years," Stephens said. USA Today is the source.
