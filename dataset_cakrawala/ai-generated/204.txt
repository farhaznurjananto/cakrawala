Destiny 2: Is It Worth Your Time?

Destiny 2 is a game that has been long-awaited since the original Destiny was released in 2014. This time around, it seems like Bungie, the developer, may have delivered on their original promises. However, the current state of Destiny 2 is more complicated than just this statement. 

In this podcast, Giant Bomb's Abby Russell joins Austin, Rob, and the author to break down their initial thoughts about Destiny 2. They discuss the good, the bad, the complex, and even some non-gaming topics like a place called "Buffalo Wild Wings". Along the way, there may be mild story spoilers, but they are kept vague.
