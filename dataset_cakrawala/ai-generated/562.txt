Imitation may be considered the sincerest form of flattery, but researchers from Japan believe that when cuttlefish mimic the arm movements of crustaceans, their intentions are far from complimentary. 

A study conducted by the University of Ryukyus, published in the Journal of Ethology, comprises videos depicting pharaoh cuttlefish exhibiting arm-flapping behavior strikingly similar to that of crabs. Concurrently, these cuttlefish were also observed to lighten their skin. Led by Kohei Okamoto, the research team postulated that the cuttlefish might be imitating hermit crabs in order to approach their prey undetected or to safeguard themselves from potential predators.

Since hermit crabs are filter feeders and do not pose a threat to the prey of cuttlefish, such as small fish and mollusks, this mimicry could enable the cuttlefish to get closer to their prey without being noticed. Okamoto further explained that mimicking the appearance of crustaceans might create the illusion of a hard shell, thus offering protection from other predatory sea creatures.

During hunting scenarios, cuttlefish that seemingly imitated hermit crabs successfully captured twice as many fish as their non-imitating counterparts. Interestingly, the cuttlefish in the study, which were hatched in the laboratory, had never been exposed to crabs. Researcher Ryuta Nakajima, who is now investigating possible environmental triggers for this behavior, pondered, "Are they learning from actual direct observation or is this programmed into genetics? [This] kind of brings up an interesting question about intelligence and complex behaviors."

One hypothesis suggests that the cuttlefish witnessed crustaceans and learned this behavior during their embryonic stage. Researchers initially observed this jointed arm behavior in 2011 while conducting other experiments on cuttlefish, noting that the cephalopod displayed the behavior in hunting situations and after being introduced to a larger tank.
