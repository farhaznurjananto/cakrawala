Renowned experts from various universities, including Constance A. Flanagan, Marvin Megibow, Lois Christensen, and Cynthia Garcia Coll address key questions surrounding parenting, adolescent development, and prejudice. They focus on prevalent issues that arise during teenage years and the significance of introducing valuable lessons about valuing differences during early development.

Teens become more conscious of social status and group rankings, making it a great time for parents to emphasize valuing differences and promoting civic engagement. Megibow explains that teens often grapple with identity and belonging, which may involve navigating difference and experiencing discrimination. Furthermore, teenagers may find themselves facing overt discrimination due to societal perceptions of their age and developing bodies.

In response to whether parents can teach lessons about valuing differences during the teenage years, Christensen believes there will always be moments when such lessons can be introduced, as adolescents possess a better understanding of complex societal dynamics. Flanagan echoes this sentiment, stating that it is never too late to instill such lessons due to the constant emergence of relevant issues.

When discussing self-segregation among teenagers, Megibow advises parents not to be overly concerned as long as other opportunities for inclusion are present. Coll encourages parents to acknowledge the natural tendency for teenagers to find comfort in like-minded individuals and suggests seeking out diverse extracurricular activities and experiences to help their children feel more at ease crossing cultural lines. Flanagan offers service learning and volunteering opportunities as a means of widening their social circles.

As many parents struggle to communicate with their teens about matters such as tolerance and prejudice, Christensen recommends using inquiry-based questions to encourage open discussion. Megibow suggests that parents make themselves available for conversations and resist accepting one-word answers, while Coll emphasizes the need for continuous communication and leading by example. By openly discussing these challenging topics and applying those values in their lives, parents contribute to the development of more inclusive teenagers.
