There was a period when video game companies relied heavily on their charming mascots to attract players, leading to a diverse range of characters. However, as the industry evolved, it started moving away from relying on cuddly protagonists. Yet, Blinx: The Time Sweeper broke the pattern, a vibrant platformer for the original Xbox that featured a time-bending cat equipped with a vacuum cleaner. Many assumed that Microsoft wanted a cute, furry face to represent their newly released gaming console. However, there is much more to the story.

To understand the full context, we must travel back to when Microsoft was establishing a development presence outside of the United States, intending to create titles that catered to foreign markets. This venture resulted in several Japan-exclusive games, including other projects like Phantom Dust, which gained a small but dedicated following. Ed Fries, former vice president of game publishing at Microsoft and Blinx executive producer, led this initiative. He recalls, “We set up a branch of Microsoft Game Studios in Japan. All the games we were doing there were meant to have a Japanese feel to them and launch first in Japan, but we always hoped that we could take them worldwide.”

One of the studios involved in this movement was Artoon, directed by renowned character designer Naoto Ohshima, who created Sonic. Ohshima had been considering the Xbox's impressive hardware capabilities before finalizing any character concepts. He explains, “We visited Microsoft and suggested creating some kind of representative cartoon game for Xbox. We asked them about the detailed specs and features of the Xbox, and then put together the proposal for Blinx.”

The team in Japan was excited by the idea of a time-controlling cat, especially when paired with the powerful processing capabilities of Microsoft’s console. Blinx co-producer Earnest Yuen adds, “The time power would require a big storage media like a hard drive, which was one of the unique features of the original Xbox.” As the project began to take shape, Ed acknowledges, “In a lot of ways, and in my mind, Blinx was the most promising game we were developing. Out of that early batch of games, it was probably the best one we were working on.”

It seems that in Japan, the goal for the character was somewhat different. Today, it’s no secret that the Xbox struggled to gain a foothold in the Japanese gaming market, dominated by PlayStation, and various measures were proposed to shift popular opinions. Consequently, Blinx was positioned as a mascot for the Japanese Xbox campaign. Earnest reveals, “We all pushed to position it as the cute mascot character for Japan.” Outside of Japan, the mascot potential became more apparent after the game started to take shape, especially during Microsoft's E3 presentation. However, Master Chief from Halo ultimately became the Xbox mascot.

When it comes to the US market, Blinx was never meant to be the next big video game mascot character, nor was it meant to compete with other platformer mascots like Mario. Ed clarifies, “There was definitely some talk [about Blinx competing with Mario], but it was more something that other people thought, not something that I considered or even something we thought within Microsoft Game Studios.” Despite the intended differences between the US and Japanese images, Blinx became associated with the mascot perception, fueled by the game's release timing and marketing strategies. Unfortunately, the game was not perceived as a success, which Ed considers unfortunate since it was an innovative and remarkable game.
