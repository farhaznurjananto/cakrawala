Indian digital agency Chimp&z has creatively reimagined Game of Thrones characters as advertising professionals, complete with witty quotes and charming vector graphics. This delightful concept sparks the imagination for a Mad Men and Game of Thrones crossover series. Here's how the characters have been transformed:

1. Jon Snow as HR: He "knows nothing" but has good intentions, much like HR.

2. Cersei Lannister as Creative Director: Despite her controversial actions, she somehow garners sympathy over time.

3. Grey Worm as Art Director: Honest and loyal with a deadly creative edge, but with a few setbacks.

4. The Unsullied as Designers: Though sometimes clueless in navigating creative challenges, they persevere in meeting clients' demands.

5. Tyrion Lannister as Copywriter: Charismatic and clever â€“ fitting for a wordsmith.

6. Mace Tyrell as Media: With the Tyrells controlling most resources, their comparison with media professionals is quite accurate.

7. Petyr Baelish as Strategist: A cunning and skilled strategist, although not entirely trustworthy.

8. Varys as Client Servicing: With formidable connections, Varys is both helpful and somewhat intimidating.

9. Three-Eyed Raven as SEO Specialist: Possessing critical information but keeping it shrouded in mystery, much like the elusive SEO Specialist.

10. Ramsay as Client No. 1: A difficult client, leaving many viewers to wonder why Joffrey didn't take this spot.

11. Melisandre as Client No. 2: Occasionally helpful but also unpredictable, her clients keep her at arm's length.

12. Sam as Intern: An obvious choice, given his enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

This creative twist on Game of Thrones characters, reimagining them as professionals in the advertising industry, offers fans an entertaining and fresh perspective on the series.
