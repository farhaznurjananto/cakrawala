The Borderlands 2 character, Tiny Tina, found herself at the center of controversy after the game's lead writer, Anthony Burch, was questioned on Twitter about stereotyping Tina's character in relation to African American culture. In the game, Tina, an explosives expert and a child, speaks using African American lingo, which one Twitter user compared to "verbal blackface". 

Mike Sacco, Creative Developer of Cryptozoic Entertainment, tweeted Burch, saying he liked Borderlands 2's writing, but that "Tiny Tina's trope of white girl talkin' like them urban folk!!" had to go. Others soon took up the debate, with one user saying, "She equates stereotyped ebonics with wacky". Those against the character's language highlighted the problematic nature of writing a character that speaks in an exaggerated and stereotyped dialect. 

However, some individuals sprang to the defense of Burch and Tina. Gearbox Head, Randy Pitchford responded to the debate by saying, "Tina is not racist because you are not racist. You're a pillar of tolerance and inclusion". Pitchford believed that the accusations of racism towards Burch's writing came from a misunderstanding of the character's intended language. 

Burch ended the conversation by stating that if Tina was problematic, he would change her, saying, "The last thing I want to be is exclusionary or prejudiced." He also confirmed that any potential change to Tina's character would only apply to future content. 

The debate surrounding the characterisation of Tiny Tina highlights the wider issues of representation in video games. Racial stereotyping has long been a topic of discussion in gaming circles, where characters are often reduced to caricatures of their ethnicity. As the industry drives for greater inclusion and diversity both on-screen and behind the scenes, it is important to continue questioning these representations to ensure that they are rooted in authenticity and respect, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
