Founder(s): Vladimir Koslov A look at society Unknown, but probably Russian and other languages. A look back at history Formation: Unknown, but probably around 2100 Dissolution: 2170 In the 22nd century, the Koslovics were fans of Vladimir Koslov, a hard-line neo-communist. They wanted to go back to the glory days of communism and get rid of the influence of corporations and capitalists, especially in orbital facilities and colonies outside of Sol. This led to the Interplanetary War, which the newly formed United Nations Space Command won against the faction in the end. [1] History of the organization [edit] As international organizations like the United Nations spread capitalism to newly colonized parts of the Solar System, communism came back with many of the same goals as it had in the 1800s and 1900s. The Koslovics were a revolutionary group of rebels who started attacking their opponents on the far right, the Jovian-based fascist Frieden. This was followed by a bloody battle in South America during the Rain Forest Wars and a last stand on Mars during the Argyre Planitia Campaign, where UNSC infantry led a decisive, fatal blow to their camps. After that, the UNSC destroyed all of the remaining Koslovic forces in the system over the course of the Interplanetary War, which lasted from 2164 to 2170,[1] and the Koslovic officially gave up in 2170 with the Callisto Treaty.
