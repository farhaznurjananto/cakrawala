As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the future of AI in 2018 and beyond is generating excitement. Key developments include the application of reinforcement learning to human problem-solving, enabling machines to model human psychology for better predictions, and using less human supervision with generative adversarial networks algorithms for computers to learn from unlabeled data.

In the healthcare sector, AI developments include personalized medicine or precision medicine, which tailors treatments to the individual, rather than relying on statistical data for larger populations. The Precision Medicine Initiative Project aims to expand cancer genomics and build a comprehensive scientific knowledge base. Additionally, AI-driven intelligent prosthetics have made great strides, with the first-ever integrated lower limb created in 2016 and an AI-powered bionic hand with a camera developed this year. Robot assistants, such as Pepper, have also begun to appear in hospitals and homes.

In the finance industry, AI and machine learning are transforming real-time data processing, risk management, trade monitoring, and intelligent cash management. The focus of big data management is shifting towards the collection of more comprehensive customer data for improved personalization of financial services. Fraud detection will improve as financial institutions leverage AI to better detect fraudulent activities and reduce false positives.

Customer experience will also be revolutionized by AI with greater personalization of customer service. Virtual assistants and chatbots that understand language and emotion will create more meaningful relationships with customers.

While there are concerns regarding machines taking human jobs, it is important to note that new types of jobs and organizational roles will emerge to manage the automation. Employees will be freed to focus on higher-value tasks and more strategic activities, while machines will take over many dangerous jobs such as bomb disposal and welding.
