In the United States Supreme Court case of United States v. Alvarez (567 U.S. 709 from 2012), the Court determined that a section of the Stolen Valor Act, which criminalized false statements about possessing a military medal, was unconstitutional. The legislation was initially introduced to deter individuals from falsely claiming to have earned medals, thereby honoring the value of genuine recipients. Although a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the law violated First Amendment free speech protections, they could not agree on a single rationale. Four justices opined that falsity alone was insufficient to deny First Amendment protection, while another two justices determined that, while false statements deserved some protection, the Stolen Valor Act was invalid as it could have achieved its goals in less restrictive ways.

The Stolen Valor Act of 2005, signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 20, 2006, broadened previous provisions concerning unauthorized wear, manufacture, or sale of military decorations and medals. It made it a misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal. Conviction could result in up to six months of imprisonment or, in the case of falsely claiming the Medal of Honor, up to one year. Congress proponents argued the law was necessary to prevent imposters from "stealing the valor" of soldiers returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2007, Xavier Alvarez falsely claimed to have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, which led to his indictment for violating the Stolen Valor Act. Although the United States District Court for the Central District of California initially rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit later reversed this decision, ruling the law as invalid. In 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government's appeal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.

During oral arguments in February 2012, the focus was on the lack of injury caused by false claims of military honors. Justices questioned whether there is any First Amendment value in falsity, given that most cases centering on false statements involved harm to another party, such as defamation. The defense argued that the First Amendment protects personal autonomy and that false claims have value as long as they do not cause imminent harm to another person or government function.

On June 28, 2012, the divided Supreme Court declared the Stolen Valor Act's prohibition on making false statements about military medal awards a violation of the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority did not reach a single consensus for their decision. In a plurality opinion, Justice Kennedy argued that false statements alone do not exclude speech from First Amendment protection and expressed concerns about the wide applicability of the Stolen Valor Act. Nonetheless, Alvarez remained in prison for fraud convictions on other matters unrelated to the Stolen Valor Act.

In response to the Supreme Court's decision, several months later, both chambers of Congress passed new versions of the Stolen Valor Act based on recommendations from the Court's opinion. Veteran organizations and politicians reacted negatively to the outcome of the case.
