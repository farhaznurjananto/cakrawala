Pope Francis is set to visit South Korea to celebrate the sixth Asian Youth Day and beatify 124 Korean martyrs. This trip to South Korea marks the first papal trip to Asia in 25 years and highlights both the Korean Catholic Church's unique history and the Pope's theological agenda.

Although South Korea is not widely viewed as a Catholic nation, at least 10% of its population belongs to the Church. The Catholic Church in Korea has high regard from non-Catholics, maintains positive relations with other religious communities, and has a history of socially engaging for the common good. Pope Francis's visit serves to recognize these accomplishments and establish their church as a model of evangelization.

Asia holds significant potential for the growth of Catholicism, and the visit highlights an Asian success story, showcasing the Asian youth who will be called on to continue that growth. Evangelization is a crucial concern for Pope Francis, as demonstrated in his apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, which calls for the transformation of the Catholic Church to focus on the evangelization of today's world.

Pope Francis's concept of evangelization extends beyond baptizing new Catholics, as he also calls for the inclusion of marginalized groups such as the homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, and the elderly. The Pope believes that the laity has an active role in evangelization, and the Korean Catholic Church resonates with this approach, having grown into a sizeable and healthy community with much of the evangelization being conducted by the laity.

The Korean Catholic Church, which began in 1784 with the baptism of a Korean scholar named Yi Seung-hun, has a history of surviving persecution. Despite challenges throughout its existence, the church has managed to survive and rebuild itself multiple times, leading to its current membership of approximately five million people.

Pope Francis's visit to South Korea not only underscores the success of the Korean Catholic Church but also serves as a message of hope for evangelization in Korea and the world at large.
