Marijuana-related businesses gathered this weekend in Reno in hopes of becoming more competitive in the industry as it moves toward legalization in Nevada.

The Nevada Medical Marijuana Conference, held at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, featured more than 100 exhibitors and dozens of speakers.

The event was organized by the Nevada Medical Marijuana Association, a nonprofit that aims to educate medical marijuana patients, providers, law enforcement and others, said Wednesday.

"What we want to do is give the industry in Nevada a voice," said Riana Durrett, the association's executive director.

Cannabis is legal for medicinal purposes in Nevada and 20 other states.

In November, voters in Colorado and Washington state approved ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

In Nevada, a bill to allow recreational use of marijuana failed to get enough legislative support this year.

A similar proposal is expected to be introduced in the next legislative session, which starts Feb. 4.

Supporters of the measure say it would raise millions of dollars in tax revenue and that people should be able to use the drug if they choose.

Opponents say legalization would lead to increased use of the drug, especially among young people.

Durrett said the Nevada association is working to build a more organized industry in the state.

"We're trying to be proactive and help the industry grow," she said.

The conference is the first of its kind in the state, she said.

Organizers expect it to be the largest marijuana-related event in Nevada.

"This is definitely a growing industry," Durrett said.
