Anna H. Wu and Daniel O. Stram Springer, October 14, 2016 - Medical - 292 pages 0 Reviews Cancer Epidemiology in Asian Americans is a big book that gives the most up-to-date research on the causes of cancer in this fast-growing part of the U.S. population. The book looks at epidemiologic methods that are usually used in migrant studies. It describes cancer patterns in Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and other Asian ethnic groups, such as Asian Indians, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other Southeast Asians. A big part of the book is reviews of analytic risk factors for different types of cancer, such as lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, liver, and others. These chapters try to explain why some cancer rates go up or down when people move, paying attention to how the prevalence of risk factors changes, how important the timing of exposures is, and other important co-factors in the cause of these cancers. There is also talk about how certain cancers are caused by genetic factors and how genes interact with the environment. This is the first book of its kind to focus on studies of cancer in Asian Americans. It lays the groundwork for learning more about the environmental and lifestyle factors that cause cancer in this group, finding gaps in our knowledge, and coming up with ways to prevent it.
