Dating has come a long way since the traditional days of meeting someone in person, and technology has played a large role in this transformation. The use of matchmaking websites has allowed individuals to pre-screen their potential partners, while location-based apps like Tinder have also become increasingly popular. The question that many are now asking themselves is how technology will shape the future of dating even further.

A new report commissioned by eHarmony and conducted by the MSc Management students at Imperial College Business School has looked at trends data from over a century of analysis and includes input from experts in anthropological, sociological, technological and biomedical fields. Full sensory virtual reality, behaviour-based matching, biotechnology and artificial intelligence are predicted to play an integral role in the future of dating.

The report predicts that by 2040, 70% of couples will meet online, with these technological interventions making the process of finding love far more efficient and precise. Romain Bertrand, the eHarmony UK country manager, suggests that this will make matching people based on deep learning of their behaviours possible. This would streamline the dating process and use artificial intelligence to enhance relationships. Ultimately, finding the perfect partner will become more manageable than ever.

Here are a few ways that this report suggests consumer technology and scientific advancements will redefine the future of dating over the next 25 years:

1. Full-sensory virtual reality

Thanks to advancements in data sharing, a full-sensory virtual reality is predicted to become fully available in the next 25 years. Technology will allow people to simulate their five senses digitally, creating a far more efficient and less time-consuming dating experience. This virtual reality dating will provide people with the same experience as a real date from the comfort of their own home. It could also redefine long-distance relationships and allow a wider dating pool of people to meet.

2. Biotechnology

Humans are programmed to find partners both attractive and genetically compatible. Through studying DNA, we may be able to unlock the secrets of attraction. While DNA research has been expensive, by 2040, the price of sequencing DNA from a cell is projected to drop to around Â£650. More affordable research could provide scientists with the data to understand better the role DNA plays in mate selection, potentially revolutionizing the matching process.

3. Behaviour-Based Matching

The Internet of Things, along with wearable technology, is increasing connectivity, and this could transform the traditional dating process. Behaviour-based matching will make finding a suitable partner even more precise since it tracks people's behaviour and how they react to different situations. Physical devices will track someone's actions, the places they visit, and the activities they engage in. Future technology such as smart contact lenses could track hormone levels to identify who a person finds attractive.

4. Artificial Intelligence

Finally, improved connectivity and artificial intelligence will play a vital role in deep learning. Singles on a date will have real-time feedback on their interactions, such as feedback on topics of conversation or an appropriate course of action. For couples, AI will help them identify issues and provide solutions. AI will even calculate the optimal time for life milestones, such as marriage, children and other relationship goals.

In summary, the next 25 years could potentially revolutionize the dating industry, and we could see the significant role of technology in this transformation. With a combination of biotechnology, AI, behaviour-based matching and virtual reality, finding love could become less complicated, and relationships could become more meaningful.
