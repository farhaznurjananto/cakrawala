There is a history of suspensions in professional sports for inappropriate language. If the league were to carefully review audio from all players wearing microphones, it is possible that several suspensions would be warranted. Unfortunately, during a recent game, Ryan Getzlaf's offensive comments were caught on tape, and it is yet to be determined what consequences he will face.

Trash talk is a normal part of competitive sports; however, homophobic slurs are not considered acceptable. In a game against the Nashville Predators, Getzlaf was heard yelling an offensive term at the referee. This situation is similar to one involving Andrew Shaw, who called a referee a homophobic slur on live television. Shaw was given a one-game suspension in the playoffs as a result. Most recently, the Toronto Blue Jays suspended center fielder Kevin Pillar for two games after he used a homophobic slur toward Atlanta Braves pitcher Jason Motte.

These examples serve to illustrate the existing consequences for offensive language in professional sports. Shaw faced suspension for his actions in Game 4, and despite it being less common for star players to receive suspensions during the playoffs, the league should continue to hold players to high standards of conduct.
