WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would look into pardoning boxing's first black heavyweight champion more than 100 years after the late Jack Johnson was convicted by an all-white jury of violating the Mann Act prohibiting interstate transport of women for "immoral" purposes.

Trump, during a White House meeting, told actor Sylvester Stallone that he was considering a posthumous pardon for Johnson, whom Stallone featured in a film about the boxer's life entitled "The Greatest," a White House official said.

"Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson," Trump said in a Twitter post. "His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!"

Johnson, who was convicted in 1913 for his relationship with a white woman, was jailed for a year and hated by many white Americans for his defiance of racial barriers in the early 1900s. He died in a 1968 car crash.

The boxer's great-great niece and the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate have been pressing for a posthumous pardon.

Stallone, in a telephone interview with Reuters, said he was "happy to hear it (the pardon consideration) is being looked at."

"It's something that's long overdue," Stallone said. "It's very important, and it's something that should've happened a long time ago."

Johnson's great-great niece, Vella Jenkins, said in a telephone interview that she was encouraged by Trump's comments.

"This is a giant step in the right direction," Jenkins said. "It would be an incredible honor for my uncle if he was posthumously pardoned by the president."

Some legal experts have said a pardon would be unlikely to be granted because Johnson was convicted on federal charges and not state charges, which would be more likely to be revisited if the president were to pardon him.

The president has the power to pardon federal crimes.

The White House official said Trump's meeting with Stallone was a chance to discuss the film and the boxer's life.
