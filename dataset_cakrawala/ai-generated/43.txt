Tuesday’s Tips

Bournemouth v Leicester – 13.30pm

Bournemouth have been struggling to take anything out of their recent Premier League games as they head into Tuesday’s clash having suffered three straight losses.

They were beaten 2-1 by Arsenal on Thursday night, and that followed a 1-0 loss at West Ham United and a 3-1 defeat at home against Crystal Palace.

The Cherries are now 20th in the table and are two points adrift of safety, although they could climb out of the drop zone if they can win on Tuesday.

Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League games, losing three of those contests, but they have won three and drawn three of their last six games at the Vitality Stadium.

The Cherries have beaten Leicester in just one of their last seven meetings with them, winning 1-0 at home in September 2017, but they have drawn three of their last five league meetings.

Leicester have been in excellent form in recent weeks, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.

The Foxes are now fifth in the table, just one point behind Tottenham Hotspur and two points ahead of Manchester City.

The Foxes have won four of their last five league games, including a 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Leicester are favourites to win this game, but Bournemouth could be worth betting on if you think they can get a result.
