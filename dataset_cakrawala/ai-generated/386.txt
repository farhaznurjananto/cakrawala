The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has initiated a probe into the recent killing of the Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr while he was inside his jail cell. The incident took place on November 5th. Espinosa was one of the first suspects named by President Rodrigo Duterte, who is leading a campaign against drugs that has resulted in the deaths of at least 4,791 people since July 1. The CHR has expressed its concern about the death of the mayor and has directed its regional office to carry out an independent investigation. Gwendolyn Pimentel Gana, who chairs the commission's task force on extrajudicial killings, has assured the public that the commission will be remaining faithful to its constitutional duty to uphold the rights of all, without distinction. The police claim that Espinosa and another detainee, Raul Yap, resisted when authorities served them search warrants for violating a law against illegal drugs which eventually led to the death of the mayor. However, Senator Panfilo Lacson has expressed his concern and alleged that he "can smell EJK," the shorthand for extrajudicial killings. The CHR has denounced all arbitrary deprivation of life as it transgresses the fundamental right espoused by key international human rights instruments and domestic laws. The killing of the mayor raises the issue of the responsibility of the state to protect persons deprived of liberty especially, in relation to the fundamental right of life of every human being. The CHR’s move comes despite Duterte’s open contempt on the commission, for questioning him over extrajudicial killings during his term as mayor of Davao City when the CHR was chaired by his current critic, Senator Leila de Lima. Duterte has repeatedly vowed to protect the policemen who kill suspects during the war on drugs, as long as it is done as a part of their legitimate operation, and has assured that he will take responsibility for their act.
