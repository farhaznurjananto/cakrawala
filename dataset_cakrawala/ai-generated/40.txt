There's more private equity money flowing into India than ever before, but the deal flow is not keeping pace.

Private equity firms invested $7.9 billion in India in 2016, compared with $2.2 billion in 2013, according to data from EY. But the number of deals has stayed steady over the past three years, at around 390 to 400, according to EY and VCCEdge, the data research arm of VCCircle.

Investors are buying larger stakes in fewer companies.

“Deal sizes have gone up over the last three years because the economy has been doing well,” said Rajat Tandon, president of Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, a trade body.

Equity valuations are at an all-time high, making it difficult for PE firms to invest in companies growing at a healthy clip.

“PE firms are only buying companies with high growth rates and high valuations,” said Gopal Jain, managing partner at Gaja Capital, a PE firm with about $800 million in assets under management.

Earlier this week, Carlyle Group agreed to buy 49% in hotel chain Ginger Hotels from Tata Group for $75 million. The deal is the largest in India this year and signals that PE firms are still interested in the country, despite the slowdown in the economy.

The slowdown in the economy is also having an impact on deal flow.

“The slowdown in the economy has caused a lot of companies to go out of favour with PE investors,” said Tandon.

Some of the companies that have been impacted the most are those in the technology and pharma sectors.

“PE investors are not as keen on investing in technology and pharma companies right now,” said Jain.

This is in contrast to early this decade, when PE firms were heavily invested in these sectors.

“The slowdown in the economy is also impacting the PE industry’s ability to raise money,” said Tandon.

This has resulted in a slowdown in the number of transactions that PE firms are able to close.
