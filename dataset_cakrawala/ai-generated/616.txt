If you're in the mood for an extraordinary musical experience that's sure to rejuvenate your senses and ignite your passion for jazz, look no further. Allow yourself to be captivated by an exceptional recording from April 28th, 1937, which was created in the vibrant city of Paris. Prepared to be amazed by an incredible tenor saxophone solo from the legendary Coleman Hawkins, a true genius of his time.

Hawkins, deeply inspired by his European adventures, returned to New York and went on to produce one of the most iconic tenor solos ever recorded on the classic ballad, "Body and Soul." Yet, in this remarkable piece, you can witness a side of his playing that perfectly encapsulates the spirit and energy of the swing era. Once you hear the electrifying drive and powerful tenor tone he infuses into this performance, it becomes undeniably clear why he held the title of the top tenor soloist throughout the 1930s.

Carter performs the enthralling alto solo toward the end of this masterpiece and is most likely responsible for the extraordinary saxophone arrangement. Carter is renowned for creating an unforgettable sound from a small saxophone section â€“ a feat that remains unrivaled in the history of jazz.

Additionally, the piece is further enriched by the unmistakable brilliance of Django Reinhardt's guitar, adding another layer of artistry to this awe-inspiring track.
