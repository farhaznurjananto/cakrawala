Phillip James Tallio wrote his young lover 116 letters, all of which repeated the same thing, in the year after he was charged of raping and murdering a child. He said that before, during, and after his trial and life sentence. He repeated that for 34 years. Even though he knew it would keep him in prison, he told relatives, correctional personnel, prison programs, and the parole board. He refused to speak it so he could get out of prison and have a life. He then repeated his 34-year-old claim: I didn't do this. A lifetime later, people listen. After years of study and analysis, the Innocence Project at the University of British Columbia has gained Mr. Tallio the opportunity to appeal his 1983 conviction for the murder of his 22-month-old cousin, Delavina Mack, over three decades after the appeal deadline. The historic appeal is based on new DNA evidence, questions about a flawed and tunnel-visioned police investigation, serious concerns about his two alleged confessions, evidence of Mr. Tallio's cognitive limitations, reports of systemic racism, and witness accounts that suggest other suspects never investigated by police.

The judge who presided over Mr. Tallio's preliminary hearing has written an affidavit claiming he has grown to doubt the man imprisoned for 34 years' guilt. Due to his refusal to acknowledge responsibility for the murder, Mr. Tallio, 51, has been denied parole since 1993. He has been in prison longer than most offenders, even for the worst crimes. If Mr. Tallio is innocent, it's Canada's longest wrongful conviction. "Sometimes I step back and say, 'Is this reality?'" his lawyer, Ms. Barsky, said. "These cases occur."
