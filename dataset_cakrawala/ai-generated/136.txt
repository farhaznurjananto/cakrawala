Angry Bird is one of my favourite games.

I love playing Angry Birds because it is very challenging and requires a lot of strategy. I also love the characters and the humour in the game. I always look forward to playing new levels and trying to beat my previous high scores. Angry Birds is a great game for any age and I highly recommend it!

Angry Birds is available on Android and iOS devices.
