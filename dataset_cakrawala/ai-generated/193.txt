Jonathan Bernstein makes a catch he's been working on for a while, that it's perfectly fine for Obama to respond to the "Socialized medicine" attack with a simple "No, it's not." I think this is correct as far as it goes, but it's not enough.

You see, for the conservative movement to work, it has to have the notion that there's an alternative to what Democrats propose. So if the alternative to Obama's health care plan is Obama's health care plan, then conservative movements don't have any alternative. Now, the alternative to Obama's health care plan is, obviously, single-payer health care, which is exactly what we have in Canada. So, if the answer to "Socialized medicine" is "No, it's not," it should be followed by "And if you think it is, you obviously don't know what socialized medicine is."

Now, I know that's not what Democrats want to do. But if Democrats want to be able to fight back efficiently against conservative attacks, they need to make it clear that there are only two health care systems under discussion here: Single-payer (which is what the rest of the developed world has) or the current system (which is a mess).

In other words, Obama needs to start arguing for a single-payer system. If he does, he can start to dismantle the conservative argument that there is an alternative to what Democrats are proposing. And that, in turn, will make it a lot harder for them to win in the future.

And that's what Democrats need to do: Fight back with a clear, concise, and well-argued argument for what their plan is, and make it clear that there is no alternative. That's what will make the difference in the long run.

Yes, it's not the most exciting thing to hear. But that's what needs to be done in order to win the debate. And that's what Obama needs to do.

Bernstein is right that Obama needs to start arguing for a single-payer system as the alternative to the current system. However, he is wrong to say that this is the only thing that Democrats need to do in order to fight back against conservative attacks. Democrats also need to make it clear that there is no alternative to their plan. This is what will make the difference in the long run.

There are two health care systems under discussion in the U.S.: Single-payer, which is
