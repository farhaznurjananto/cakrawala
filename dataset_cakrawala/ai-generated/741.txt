Who would have thought that the container used to transport takeout food could be the food itself?  
 For the right consumer, yes. 
 Scientists have discovered that mealworms actually eat Styrofoam, which could represent a glorious step forward in the fight to eliminate plastic waste. 
  Researchers from Beihang University in China and Stanford University in California reached this conclusion after feeding the larvae of  American beetles, worms, nothing but Styrofoam. Insects not only break down the plastic into biodegradable compounds, but after that they are just as healthy  as the worms they normally eat.

 The secret is the microorganisms in the worms' digestive system. These "bugs-within-the-bugs" produce an enzyme that breaks down the foam into organic compounds. What the mealworms don't digest, they expel as biodegradable substances that return to nature.  
 "The findings are revolutionary," Stanford University engineer Wei-Min Wu, told CNN. "This is one of the biggest breakthroughs in environmental science in the past ten years."

 On the heels of this awesome revelation, scientists will pursue a theory that these enzymes could potentially also be used to break down other forms of plastic, like microbeads polluting the world's oceans. â€œSometimes science surprises us.
