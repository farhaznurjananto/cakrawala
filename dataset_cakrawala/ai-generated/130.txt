First used in a memo dated Dec. 3, 1945, the term became widely used in the media and public discourse in the 1950s and 1960s and was even used in congressional hearings.

The term "brainwashing" was popularized by American journalist Edward Hunter who was a CIA propaganda specialist during the Korean War. Hunter claimed that Chinese communists had perfected a method of indoctrination so effective that anyone who underwent it would be reduced to a "robot-like state," unable to think independently or critically.

The term has been used in popular culture in books and movies, including the 1956 movie "The Manchurian Candidate," in which soldiers captured during the Korean War were brainwashed into becoming sleeper agents for the Soviets. \

In recent years the term has been applied to the phenomenon of young people being radicalized by extremist groups, including the Islamic State, or ISIS.

In June 2015, for example, then-President Barack Obama said he was "very concerned" about "the possibility of radicalization of Americans" by ISIS.

In December 2015, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice was "looking to de-radicalize" people who were "susceptible to the messaging" of terrorist groups.
