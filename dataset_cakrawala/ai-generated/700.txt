Good for Chris Collins. The Clarence representative was one of only 75 Republicans to vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security rather than hold it hostage to a suicide charge against President Obama's immigration executive orders. Collins stated on Tuesday, "I am here to govern" "I did not come here to stumble from one crisis to the next."
