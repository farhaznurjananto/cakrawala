Craft brewing in America has been on the rise and it is partly thanks to the prohibition era. There has been a doubling of the number of US breweries from around 1,500 in 2007 to over 3,000 today, with craft beer accounting for only a small portion (8%) of the beer market. Two large companies, Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors still hold roughly three-quarters of the market. However, craft brewing is steadily gaining ground. 

The craft brewing industry owes its success to a significant shift in American beer consumers’ tastes. The previous preference for the unflavored American-style lagers has shifted in favor of hoppy IPAs and flavorful stouts. In fact, beer buffs estimate that the craft beer market still has a tremendous potential for growth, akin to other artisanal products. 

Craft beer's success rests on the changes to the regulations of alcohol, which allowed brewers to respond to consumer demands. America's unique booze regulation system was shaped by the 21st Amendment. The amendment was intended to give dry states the right to prohibit interstate commerce in alcohol. After its passage, the 50 states began implementing Beer Franchise laws to recreate the beneficial aspects of Prohibition. The law was meant to keep beer distribution local and maintain control of sales, thereby limiting drunkenness. Today, the resulting “three-tier system” ensures that breweries sell beers to distributors, who then sell to retailers like liquor stores or bars, rather than directly to consumers. 

This system helps craft brewers keep their markets open as large national brewers can not control the distribution channel. If such a thing were possible, they would open bars and offer only their particular brands to the exclusion of smaller breweries’ brands. Deregulation and changes in the three-tier system have been boosted by small brewers since the late 1970s and early 80s. Since 2013, there has been a 50% increase in craft beer exports, suggesting that growth is imminent. 

Notwithstanding, there are still high barriers. For instance, the libertarian Mercatus Center found that a Virginia entrepreneur would have to go through 12 application procedures to open a brewery, in addition to normal small business requirements. However, the growing industry and increasing sales suggests that the future looks promising for craft brewing in America.
