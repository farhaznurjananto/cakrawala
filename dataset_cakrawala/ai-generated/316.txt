Pakistan faces a severe drinking water crisis, with many citizens having limited access to potable water. In January, Mohammad Riaz, a father of five and chauffeur in the Karachi squatter colony of Shirin Jinnah, decided to switch to bottled water due to the poor quality of water supplied by government agencies. His daughter, Aasia, who lives next door with her family, reports insects crawling in the water, saltiness, cloudiness and impurities retained even when filtered. It is a situation that's not uncommon in Pakistan: earlier that month, an area resident filed a constitutional petition against several governmental offices, stating that they have failed to ensure the provision of potable water, sanitation and a hygienic environment, as required by law.

In response to the petition, the Supreme Court of Pakistan set up a commission, comprised of a nine-member task force and headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro of the Sindh High Court, to investigate. Over a thirteen month period, the task force collected 460 water samples from 14 districts in Sindh, which were then subjected to physicochemical and microbiological analyses to establish their fitness for consumption. Villages were excluded from the task force's remit, with the team instructed to only focus on major urban centres where water was supplied by governmental agencies so that officials could be held to account as "public-trustees." Thar, which is remote and underdeveloped, was the only area that did not meet this criteria, as the government had already invested heavily in reverse osmosis plants there.

The analysis revealed that 83.5% of water in 14 out of 29 districts in Sindh, including Karachi, where over two and a half million residents are said to be affected, is unsafe for drinking purposes. In particular, 107 (90.7%) of the water samples collected from various places in Karachi were revealed to be unsuitable for drinking. Contamination contributed to this result, with 40% of samples showing the presence of E. coli, and 17.8% showing levels of turbidity beyond the safe limit. 

This situation has left communities who lack access to clean water with few options. Riaz and his family work as domestic helpers in better-off areas of Karachi, which means that they can afford to buy more expensive drinking water, but can still only use it sparingly to make it last through the month. Typically, Riaz's family members must purchase a container of water for Rs200 ($1.80) every other day to have enough drinking water on hand to get by.

Those in positions of power have weighed in on the crisis. Ghulam Murtaza, who was appointed as the amicus curiae for the commission, has heard from Justice Kalhoro that he is perplexed and frustrated with the results and that officials should have been able to produce examples of clean water supply. The head of the Karachi Water and Sanitation Board (KWSB), interviewed by The Third Pole, appears to concede that there are problems with the water supply, but admits that there are limitations to what the government can do, given the size of the population and the scale of the infrastructure. Despite this, the country clearly needs drastic action: with waterborne diseases on the rise due to dirty water, the human cost of inaction is very high.
