This image depicts every item I possess. If you have OCD, you are able to count. I see roughly sixty items. I could be much more minimalist, but it would require more daily effort. I could have more belongings, but I enjoy how everything fits in my compact backpack. I have traveled the world for the past year with nothing but this, and it has been sufficient. I hiked through snow above the arctic circle in late November and climbed mountains in the sweltering heat of central India in the summer, and this was sufficient. Yes, that is everything, excluding the camera I used to take the photo. It means I was entirely, never mind. Let's proceed and avoid looking into reflective surfaces. Let me simplify everything for you. When asked how many clothing I have, I typically respond, "roughly a week's worth." Regardless of the weather, this is true because of layering. Any less laundry would be bothersome, and any more would be too heavy. Merino wool is a wonder fabric that will continue to appear throughout the text. This is not the itchy, heavy, and too warm wool of your youth. This comes from New Zealand's high-altitude sheep. It is light, soft, warm, thin, wicks away perspiration, dries rapidly, and never odors. I don't profess to fully comprehend the magic behind this item, but due to its awesomeness, it has infiltrated nearly every element of my wardrobe. The majority of these are T-shirts, and fifty percent are merino wool. I could definitely survive on this portion alone, but I prefer a bit more variety. T-shirts can be worn as an underlayer for warmth, as an outer layer for style, or on their own when the weather is warm. You never have to worry about appearing like a tourist because they are quite adaptable and are worn globally. The T-shirts comprised of merino wool include Icebreaker Tech Ts and Smartwool Microweight Ts. The only significant difference is that Smartwool shirts are thinner and cooler. I've worn them rock climbing and dancing all night in smoke-filled bars. When I smelled like someone emptied an ashtray into a sauna for sumo wrestlers the following day, these shirts always smell freshly laundered. Although they are more expensive than a simple cotton T-shirt, I highly suggest them. The remainder of my T-shirts are by various artists that I admire. They are thin for really hot days and come in more vibrant hues than merino wool shirts. Also, there is one collared shirt for when I need to dress up a bit. I occasionally have great dinners while traveling for work, and it's important to present a clean appearance. The reliable Icebreaker Long-Sleeve Zip has always kept me incredibly warm in cooler weather. It is sleek and tidy on its own, and it layers well. The shirt on the far left is also a reliable staple; it is essentially a lightweight cardigan with a zipper that makes any shirt I wear it over appear dapper. Despite the fact that I stumbled upon this in a store in Montreal, I'm certain you can find a comparable layering piece. Legs The first item is my jeans. As I was only going to have one pair of jeans, I made sure they were of high quality, fit well, were attractive, and would last. I went to Self Edge in San Francisco and tried on numerous pairs of jeans until I found the ideal pair. During the next few weeks, they loosened up, and now I've never had a more comfortable pair of shoes. I feel like they've grown alongside me because they've been on the same number of adventures that I have. Every blemish has a tale. The Cloudveil Convertible Pants are beneath. I am aware that convertible pants will never be fashionable, but for times when you are hiking, rock climbing, doing yoga, or just need a cooler, more flexible choice, these work wonderfully and were the least dorky option I could find. During an unexpectedly lengthy hike during a heat wave, the ability to convert them to shorts is priceless, and as shorts they serve admirably as swim trunks. During severely cold weather, I even wore them over my pants as an additional layer. I've begun experimenting with Outlier Climbers because Cloudveil Convertibles are no longer available. They are elegant enough to serve as dress pants, yet stretchy enough for rock climbing and yoga. Moreover, they are robust enough to travel
