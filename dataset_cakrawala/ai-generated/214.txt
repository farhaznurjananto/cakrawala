Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's charity, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, has pledged $3m to tackle the ongoing Silicon Valley housing crisis. The donation will be given to the Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, an organization which aims to provide legal services to families who have been evicted from their homes. This organization will now be able to help an additional 2,500 families in East Palo Alto, Belle Haven and North Fair Oaks thanks to the grant.

Along with this donation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will also donate an additional $500,000 to the Terner Center for Housing & Innovation at UC Berkeley. The organization is attempting to increase the supply of housing in high-cost areas in order to decrease the cost of living in the region.

These donations will be particularly welcome given the level of controversy that Zuckerberg has been involved with in relation to housing in the area. In 2013, he purchased four homes surrounding his Palo Alto mansion for more than $30m. His intention was to prevent new neighbours from moving in, but this resulted in criticism. When plans were proposed to demolish the homes around his mansion, these proposals were blocked by an architectural review board in September 2016.

Despite criticism, Zuckerberg remains committed to improving housing in the area, and his donations will make a significant difference to families who have been evicted from their homes. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative hopes that its donations will make a positive contribution to solving the housing crisis in Silicon Valley.
