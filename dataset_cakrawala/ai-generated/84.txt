What did I do? I made a list. I’ve been making lists for a long time. When I started this business I made a list of topics that I’d like to write about. When I started my first blog, I made a list of ideas for blog posts. When I started travelling, I made a list of places I wanted to go.

When I started making money online, I made a list of all the things I wanted to buy. When I started my first business, I made a list of all the people I needed to talk to. When I started my second business, I made a list of all the things I needed to do.

I’ve made lists for my personal life too. I have a list of books I want to read, movies I want to watch, and things I want to do. I even have a list of things I want to do before I die.

Why do I make lists? Because they help me focus. When I have a list, I know exactly what I need to do. I don’t have to worry about forgetting anything. I can just look at my list and get to work.

Lists help me stay organized and on track. They keep me focused and motivated. They make me feel in control. And they make me happy.

If you don’t have a list, you should start making one. It’s the best way to stay focused, organized, and motivated. And it will make you happy too.
