PHILADELPHIA â€” Sen. Bernie Sanders made his first public appearance here Monday on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and the Vermont senator told a crowd of several hundred supporters that he will vote for Clinton in November.

"I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years," Sanders said, beginning his remarks at Temple University. "I know her as a fierce fighter for the rights of children and she will make an outstanding president."

Sanders said that Clinton understands that the economy is rigged and that the American dream is lost. He said her election will help protect civil rights and voting rights and that she will "work to transform our energy system and take bold steps to protect this planet."

"Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here today," Sanders said.

Sanders made the comments as he plans to hold a meeting with his delegates here Tuesday to discuss their next course of action. The senator has been seeking ways to unify the Democratic Party after a divisive primary fight.

Sanders's decision to endorse Clinton shows how far he has come in the last few days. Late last week, he appeared to be inching closer to endorsing Clinton, but he continued to say he would not do so until the party's platform was more progressive.

Monday's appearance was part of a three-day swing through Pennsylvania that will also take him to Columbus and Cleveland. Clinton is aiming to win the state, which has 20 electoral votes.

Clinton greeted Sanders after his remarks and the two posed for photos.

Sanders's endorsement could help Clinton in a state where she is weak with African American voters. In a recent poll, Clinton was only ahead of Trump by six points with black voters.

Clinton also has the support of President Obama, who has endorsed her.

Sanders's decision to endorse Clinton comes as some Sanders supporters are considering third-party candidates.

Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, said that Sanders's endorsement is an important step in the general election.

"Sen. Sanders has always been a strong ally of Hillary Clinton and his endorsement today proves that he is focused on November's decisive election and putting America first," Mook said in a statement.

Sanders's endorsement of Clinton was first reported by The Associated Press.
