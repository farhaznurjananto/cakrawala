Introduction:

As the popularity of Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO) continues to soar, leading companies such as Valve, DreamHack, and MLG have their sights set on expanding the game into new countries like Canada and China. Two companies leading the charge in bringing Counter-Strike to North America are MLG and DreamHack, both well-known within the gaming community. The first major CS:GO event to take place in America was held in Columbus, Ohio and set a record with over 1.3 million people watching in-game at once. It also boasted the then-largest prize pool of $1,000,000, a landmark for CS:GO.

DreamHack Expansion:

DreamHack's expansion into North America has garnered much excitement from the CS:GO eSports community. DreamHack Austin 2016, which took place on May 6-8, 2016, featured eight teams and a prize pool of $100,000. In addition to Austin, DreamHack unveiled its second event taking place during the summer in Montreal, Canada. Canadian fans eagerly anticipated a local DreamHack event, and after three years of waiting, Montreal finally hosted one on August 12-14, 2016. As of now, only Bring-Your-Own-Computer (BYOC) tournaments are confirmed, and no specific CS:GO-related events have been announced for Montreal.

Valve, MLG, and Other Companies:

With the enormous success of MLG Columbus in terms of both viewership and prize pool, the prospect of a partnership between Valve and MLG could lead to an annual North American major event. This would solidify the expansion of CS:GO in North America and pave the way for Valve to focus on expanding into Asian markets. As MLG and DreamHack continue their efforts to establish CS:GO in North America, the industry will likely experience substantial growth in the eSports sector. The future of the gaming scene looks promising as we eagerly wait to see what incredible developments come next.
