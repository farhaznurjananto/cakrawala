Shootings of American soldiers on U.S. soil made headlines all over the world after they were reported at Fort Hood. There were 13 fatalities and 38 injuries. The news almost defied belief in its ghastliness. Almost. Sad to say, the massacre at Fort Hood wasn't the first time this year that American service members were killed on American soil. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot and killed an Army private in June at a recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, and injured another soldier. The fact that the perpetrators in both cases had been the subject of an FBI investigation only added to the tragedy of losing such promising young soldiers. It would be simple to place blame on the FBI in the more recent case. According to its counterterrorism agents, Maj. Nidal Hasan's contacts with radical cleric Anwar al-Aulaqi were business-related. Al-Aulaqi was an al-Qaeda sympathizer and served as a "spiritual adviser" to two of the 9/11 hijackers. While the results of an in-depth probe will tell us whether or not other warning signs should have prompted preventative measures, there is one thing we can say with certainty: The FBI's investigation into Hasan's handgun purchase was hampered by a law that has widespread bipartisan support, making it difficult to circumvent. The revelation of such a purchase could and probably would have prompted intense scrutiny. Also, it might have prevented some deaths. The FBI had access to background check records for firearm purchases for up to 180 days during the Clinton administration. However, legislation passed in 2003 mandated a 24-hour record destruction period. As a result of this mandate, which is just one of many restrictions on gun data sponsored by Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.), Hasan's investigators were unable to check records to see if he or other terrorist suspects had purchased firearms. Hasan's record at Guns Galore in Killeen, Texas, was only accessible to the FBI for a brief window of time before it was erased forever. According to former FBI agent Brad Garrett: "A crucial clue like the gun's location was missed. One issue is that the law can limit your options." Congress's Tiahrt amendments make it more difficult to store, share, and investigate information about weapons purchases by people suspected of terrorism. Furthermore, Congress has neglected to rectify a legal loophole that would allow the FBI to prevent a sale to a suspect in a terrorism investigation. The Bush administration's request to have the FBI be given the authority to prevent firearms sales to people suspected of being terrorists was rejected by Congress. Attorney General Eric Holder has once again stated the Obama administration's support for this legislation last week, and with good reason. According to a June report by the Government Accountability Office, 865 people on the terror watch list have bought firearms and explosives from legal U.S. vendors in the past five years. The tragic lesson of September 11th was that barriers between federal agencies and efficient investigational methods must be dismantled if innocent Americans are to be protected from terrorist attacks. A tragic reminder that such barriers still exist was the attack on Fort Hood. There will be further catastrophic security breaches and tragic loss of life until Congress musters the political courage to dismantle them. Legislators must act to reform the Tiahrt amendments and strengthen the background check system; otherwise, the next terrorist shooting on American soil will be shocking but not unexpected.
