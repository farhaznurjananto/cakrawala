Deceptive Business Practices: How Companies Prey on Consumer Ignorance

In today's digital world, companies are finding ways to make money that exploit consumer ignorance. Two common practices are unwanted downloads and hidden subscriptions. These practices have become so common that many people have come to accept them. However, it begs the question, how ethical are these actions?

Unwanted Downloads 

One of the most common ways companies get away with unwanted downloads is by adding bloatware to their programs. For example, Oracle and Adobe commonly add browsers, toolbars, download managers, and other features even to required security updates. The companies receive a royalty on each successful installation, which depends on users not paying attention.

The addition of unnecessary software to downloads is not only inconvenient, but it also poses security risks. Many of these applications can be malicious and expose users to potential data breaches. The fact that these bloatware installations often depend on users not paying attention only exacerbates the problem. It's not only unethical, but it's also downright sneaky. 

Hidden Subscriptions 

Another deceptive practice is that of hidden subscriptions. Companies such as ringtone services are notorious for signing people up without their knowledge or consent. Typically, customers only find out about the unwanted service by scrutinizing their phone bills. Many people are shocked to learn that they have been charged for such services for months, and even years.

In a recent case, a company had been charging a customer over $20 in monthly subscription fees for a service they had never heard of. Only by closely examining their phone bill had they discovered the charges. Itâ€™s scary when one considers that these charges could have gone unnoticed indefinitely without careful scrutiny.

Fighting Deception 

It's not just a few companies exploiting consumer ignorance. This deception has become widespread, with projections suggesting that businesses using these shady practices will only increase in number. As consumers, we must be vigilant and scrutinize our bills carefully. The difference between a few dollars and thousands more on an annual basis could be a hidden subscription you don't know about.

Companies need to be held accountable for this behavior. It's time the public called them out for their unethical practices. Consumers are entitled to transparency and a fair approach to business, especially when it comes to sensitive issues like software installations and subscriptions. Next time you download an update, be sure to read it carefully and uncheck any boxes that look suspicious. It's a small action that can potentially save you from months of unwanted charges.
