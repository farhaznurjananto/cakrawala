The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of the United States has implemented a ban on the sale of five chemicals used in the production of synthetic marijuana. So-called incense containing these chemicals will now be prohibited from sale for at least one year, with the ruling becoming official from Tuesday.

Fake marijuana containing the banned substances is sold under various brands such as K2, Spice, Yucatan Fire, and Red X Dawn. These products consist of natural leaves that have been coated with chemicals that claim to provide users with a high similar to that of marijuana. However, this chemical mixture, which is widely popular with young people, can produce several adverse effects, resulting in emergencies, hospitalizations, and even death. 

Federal drug officials announced their intention to enforce an emergency regulation back in November after increasing reports of bad reactions to the chemicals. The ban will cover the five chemicals that are most commonly used in synthetic marijuana production known by the street names JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-200, CP-47,497, and cannabicyclohexanol.

In the past, fake marijuana was a legal loophole, but officials have announced a crackdown on it, calling it dangerous and unhealthy. The DEA ban is an attempt to curb the consumption of synthetic marijuana as some retailers mix the chemicals themselves, leading to an inconsistency in the potency and quality of the product.

Users attempting to get a marijuana-like high from synthetic marijuana, also known as K2 or Spice, sometimes experience severe adverse effects. These include high blood pressure, terror attacks, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, to name a few. Reports have shown that individuals being treated because of the adverse effects experienced by the synthetic drug have more than doubled in recent years.

Marc Kurzman, a Minneapolis attorney who represented four shops that sell the products, filed petitions for court injunctions, stating that the DEA has no right or evidence to support their claims. He has argued that the DEA has no jurisdiction to ban these chemicals and that its claims regarding their effects are untrue. In January, a U.S. district judge dismissed his suit, stating that it is premature because the DEA has not yet acted. Kurzman filed a petition for review today in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and a new case in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota.

The ban covers an estimated 100 million dollars in synthetic-drug commerce, which has infuriated some entrepreneurs. Some individuals refer to the DEA move as an attempt to suppress small businesses. But the DEA stated that synthetic drugs such as K2 pose public health risks, and this regulation is aimed at protecting public health and safety. 

In the meantime, Kurzman's clients and other establishments that sell these products are disposing of them ahead of the ban, which comes into effect on Tuesday. The ban on the five chemicals used to produce synthetic marijuana, although challenged by some parties, is a well-intentioned move by the government to deal with the growing health crisis by battling against illicit and powerful psychoactive drugs.
