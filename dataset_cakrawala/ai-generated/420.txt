After much dedication and effort, the time has come for me to part ways with this project and move on. Despite my hard work and determination, I have ultimately realized that the necessary hardware and software required to complete the project are not compatible with my needs. Although I may be considered a beginner in the realm of NFC, I believe I have gained a great deal of knowledge and would be open to answering any questions from those interested in the hack. For now, I have decided to abandon the project, but I am hopeful that I will have opportunities to work on similar ventures in the future. As such, I will make sure to keep everyone updated on the progress of any such projects.
