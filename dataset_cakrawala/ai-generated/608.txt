Alabama's head football coach, Nick Saban, is all too familiar with the challenges that come along with maintaining continued success. Fresh off of their national title, Saban will have to instill a sense of urgency in his players to avoid any complacency. This Crimson Tide team has played at an elite level, capturing four national championships in the last seven years, and almost always being just one game or play away from another championship in the off-years.

As we approach the Southeastern Conferenceâ€™s annual media days, Alabama, the defending national champion, will yet again be among the top contenders for the upcoming playoffs. It is this very success that has put a target on their back; other teams will be eager to challenge and defeat Alabama, hoping to make their season with a victory against the reigning champions. In order to maintain their high level of performance, Saban emphasizes the importance of consistency over the long term.

Complacency is a dangerous foe for Saban's team, and he is well aware of its consequences. Having achieved a significant level of success, Saban's players may struggle to keep up their motivation to excel. Key to their continued success will be finding a balance between clearing distractions, or "clutter," and staying on course with the team's goals. Some off-season events, such as the arrests of two important team players and coaching staff changes, have created distractions that may challenge the team's focus.

However, Alabama's talent may just be enough to overcome these obstacles. The team proved last year that they could bounce back from adversity after an early season loss to Ole Miss, ultimately coming together as a group and winning the national title. This year's team will face a new set of challenges, but if they can fight the human desire to merely survive and instead strive to be the best, they will be poised for yet another successful season.

Overall, dealing with the pressure of maintaining a championship-winning team is a daunting task, but it is a challenge one can be glad to have. With Saban's dedication and guidance, Alabama football's future looks bright.
