In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, rallies demanding the resignation of President Joseph Kabila have resulted in at least 17 fatalities. Three of them were police officers, and one of them, according to Interior Minister Evariste Boshab, was burned alive. Oppositional groups, however, claimed that 50 people passed away, and a witness said that police shot live gunfire into the crowd. On one of the main roads in Kinshasa, the capital of the nation, protesters erected barricades and set automobiles on fire. After the protests were over, the dead were spotted lying in the streets. The electoral commission was supposed to declare a date for the upcoming presidential elections on Monday, but they will not be held that day due to scheduling conflicts. According to the opposition, Mr. Kabila is attempting to put off the polls in order to stay in office past the end of his two-term limit in December.

Hundreds of protestors are in the streets, and police have made at least 10 arrests, according to BBC Afrique's Poly Muzalia in the capital. The majority of Kinshasa's schools and businesses are closed, and those who are not protesting are remaining inside to prevent any problems, our reporter continues.

Most opposition parties have boycotted a government-sponsored attempt called a "national discussion" to find a resolution to the political crisis. On December 20, Mr. Kabila's second term, which is the maximum permitted by the nation's constitution, will come to an end. In comparable protests the previous year, at least 12 people died. Since its independence more than 55 years ago, the DR Congo has never experienced a seamless transfer of authority.
