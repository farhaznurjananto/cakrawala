Once a French neologism, precarity is now a global phenomenon. According to the European Precarity Observatory, “precariousness is not an experience exclusively reserved for the poor. . . . [I]t is a social phenomenon that affects all social classes.” The term “precarity” describes a condition of instability, insecurity, or fragility. Precariousness is often caused by the recent rise in temporary, insecure, or low-paid work; the growth of the informal economy; and the decline of social protection.

Precarious work follows no single model. It can be full-time or part-time, paid or unpaid, temporary or permanent. What precarious work has in common is that it is often insecure, unstable, and low-paid.

Precarious workers are found in all sectors of the economy, from agriculture to manufacturing to service industries. They are often employed in the informal economy, in jobs that are not regulated by labor laws or social protection schemes. In developed countries, precarious workers are often immigrants or women.

Precarious work is a global phenomenon, but it is particularly widespread in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, more than 60% of the workforce is employed in precarious jobs.

The consequences of precarious work are wide-ranging. Precarious workers are often forced to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They are less likely to receive benefits from their employers, and they are more likely to be laid off or to have their hours reduced. They are also more likely to be exposed to health and safety risks, and to experience physical and psychological violence at work.
