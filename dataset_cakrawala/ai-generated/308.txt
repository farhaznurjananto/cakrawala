Arizona is a state that has adopted the trend of pre-emption. Conservative states have overruled local ordinances on a variety of issues such as taxicab licensing, the minimum wage, workplace discrimination, and bathroom usage. This trend has become the most powerful tactic of our time. While it began as an industry-driven attempt to abolish gun and smoking restrictions at the city level, it has now become an attempt to stifle any local initiative that a statehouse doesn't agree with. Arizona's statehouse has been particularly aggressive in dismantling local control in three left-leaning cities: Tempe, Tucson, and Phoenix. Arizona's Legislature has suppressed all sorts of local laws, from those dealing with puppies, to those regulating guns, and even those about plastic bags. It has also passed a new law this year that suspends city funding for services like police and fire if there is a conflict between city and state laws.

Phoenix, Arizona is the country's sixth-largest city, and it seems like the state Legislature is trying to counteract the city's every move. Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, is steering the city through this challenge. When speaking about the divide between the urban areas and the state Legislature, Stanton says that it is merely a matter of who they represent. Legislators need to win their primaries, which means moving further left or right. So, extreme polarization occurs in the Legislature with a conservative majority. This has led to cities, like Phoenix, missing out on the opportunity to experiment with big public policies. The Legislature has taken away the cities' abilities to try new things that may work. Climate change is expected to be the next major battleground between the cities and the state Legislature. Phoenix will try to adopt more aggressive climate policies but is under constant threat of pre-emption by the Legislature since a majority of legislators are climate deniers.

Arizona passed a mother-of-all pre-emption laws in the last legislative session. The law states that if any local ordinance contradicts state law, then the state will retract all state shared revenue. For Phoenix, that adds up to $400 million. It has created a chilling effect, whereas the cities that are passing progressive policies are the ones that are also seeing an increase in economic activity. The law is unconstitutional on numerous grounds, and the Arizona League of Cities and Towns is planning to file a lawsuit on behalf of the city of Phoenix.

Mayor Stanton is not afraid of the state Legislature's attempts to stifle the city's policies. The city will do what is right for its people regardless of the state law. Stanton believes that the mother-of-all pre-emption laws will not affect the city's business. However, it remains an issue that would cross party lines.
