Joshua Freeman, CP24.com A group of Toronto police officers are now facing disciplinary action after an internal investigation into their behaviour at the Pride Parade. The investigation, which wrapped up in December, was launched after a video surfaced online of two officers riding an unmarked cruiser while wearing costumes. The video, which was posted to YouTube, shows the officers dressed in shorts and tank tops and dancing to music while driving the cruiser. According to a police source, the officers were dressed as members of the Mounties and the video was shot on June 26, 2016. The officers have been identified as constables Kristine Rae and Danielle Bottineau. They have been charged with insubordination under the Police Services Act. The charge has not been proven. The officers are scheduled to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice on March 28. In a statement released Thursday, police said that an additional six officers who were in the cruiser at the time are also facing disciplinary charges. It is unclear what those charges are. The officers are all members of the force’s 51 Division. “The Toronto Police Service holds its members to a high standard of professional conduct and the alleged conduct in this matter is not in keeping with the values and standards expected of police officers,” the statement said. Police said that the officers involved have been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of their court case.
