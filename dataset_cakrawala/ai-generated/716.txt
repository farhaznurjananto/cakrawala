HURLBURT FIELD, FLA. – A US special tactics operator recently witnessed the need for airstrikes to defuse an impending firefight between Taliban combatants in Afghanistan. According to Col. Michael Martin, commander of the 24th Special Operations Wing, the AC-130 gunship circling overhead delivered 105mm cannon rounds so precise that they screeched down just 13 meters from where US and coalition troops were stationed. Air Force and Army special operators, along with coalition partners, collaborate in fast-paced environments to coordinate targeted attacks from the air to the ground. Martin stated that the contingents are fully "committed to fusing air and ground maneuver to defeat the enemy" in the ongoing campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Martin told Military.com on Thursday that Air Force personnel are "involved" in ongoing operations across Mosul, including calling in precision strikes. According to Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, US advisers were moving with elite Iraqi forces outside the city units just last week, but remained behind the "forward line of" Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service units. Martin added some more information. "Dismounted on foot, and guys in operations providing a level of support to our Iraqi counterparts to put lethal fires precisely on our targets and enable them to continue the advance," Martin explained. He declined to comment on the involvement of US elite forces in the assault on Raqqa, Syria, which began earlier this month.

However, the responsibilities and tasks of thwarting the enemy now fall to "the guys we've spent a lot of time training," according to Martin. "The enemy's desire to project violence continues. They're inexperienced, so they'll be more deliberate and tactically focused," he said. "But some of these fights aren't ours; we're here to enable and support, so we might not be standing shoulder to shoulder, but behind. We have their back." "We're not the guy in the door first; we're the guy in the door second now in Iraq, Afghanistan — fighting the Islamic State, the Taliban, and so on," Martin reiterated. Last week, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter visited Hurlburt Field to see the Air Force's 21 Special Tactics Squadron and 8th Special Operations Squadron, as well as the Army's 7th Special Forces Group, train in hostile conditions. Carter witnessed personnel recovery training, a "core mission for us that we are currently deployed supporting in that capacity," according to Martin. "Today, we were looking at a number of the special operations forces' assault capabilities," Carter explained. "This is a capability that we use almost every day, somewhere on the planet." However, it foreshadows what the special operators may face in the future. The Next 'Gray Zone' Martin stated that AFSOC units, for example, are spending time training on how quickly units can position themselves for the next fight, where planning and details can change in an instant. "We thrive on what is a requirement in the military, and we have strategies, theories, and vision statements that we try to drive toward," Martin said in a follow-up interview Friday. However, Martin believes that now is the time to turn a wary eye East, to the conflicts in Ukraine and threats from adversaries such as North Korea. Paying attention to "how they have evolved, what does that mean in a contested or degraded environment based on their capability? It's not the same as dealing with a counterterrorism threat." Expect a shift in AFSOC operations to the anti-access area denial space, or A2/AD, in the coming years, he said, referring to weapons and capabilities designed to keep the US from approaching or encroaching on foreign territories and holdings, or prohibiting access to global common areas.

"The techniques we use in the Middle East don't work as well in Eastern Europe or, say, the Republic of Korea because those environments don't support it in the austere sense [because] we rely on the infrastructure we have in place that would allow us to be more precise, or more lethal," he explained. Basic communication technologies "could be" used in these locations.
