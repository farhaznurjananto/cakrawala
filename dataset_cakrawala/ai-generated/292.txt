US Marines Arrive in Darwin as Part of Bilateral Agreement

The first wave of 250 US Marines has arrived in Darwin, Australia, as part of a bilateral agreement between the two nations to rotate American troops through the country. This agreement was announced in November 2011, with the initial deployment to consist of 250 Marines. The ceremony to welcome the first contingent took place outside Darwin and was attended by Australian Defense Minister Stephen Smith.

The group of Marines belongs to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, and they are the vanguard of a 2,500-strong force expected to deploy to Australia. Under the agreement, Marines will rotate through Darwin, based in the sparsely populated Northern Territory of Australia, for six months at a time. The current company-size element will be expanded to a battalion-strength group of roughly 1,000 Marines by 2014, and eventually grow to a 2,500 air-ground task force by 2016.

The plan, designed to strengthen the US-Australian defense relationship, has been welcomed by some Australians while others have expressed concern about the increased military presence in the country. However, Darwin Mayor Katrina Fong Lim has said that most residents are looking forward to the arrival of the troops. Robertson Barracks, which hosted the initial ceremony, is situated in the suburb of Holtze in the municipality of Litchfield.

This deployment marks an important milestone in the US-Australian alliance, demonstrating the importance placed on cooperation and mutual security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. It also represents a significant achievement in the development of the US Marine Corps as an expeditionary force able and ready to operate in a wide range of environments.
