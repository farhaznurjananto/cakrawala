During Tuesday's Game 4 against the Celtics, LeBron James struggled at times. He had four fouls in the first half, missed an open dunk, and was generally careless with the ball. But, my goodness, did he take Jaylen Brown to school. Take a look at this move. You can't justify it because oh. That carries. The rook is being schooled. twitter.com/jYMUHfH2Kv Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) is a sports news website. May 24, 2017 Somewhere, Fred Hoiberg screamed at his TV because LeBron James got away with one of the most obvious carries of the season to set up that thunderous baseline dunk. While making his move, LeBron picks up his dribble before dribbling again and passing Brown. Cleveland eventually won 112-99. This is not a fair picture in the least. twitter.com/rddEY0jMMj May 24, 2017 Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) The move was incredible, but NBA fans were understandably upset that a major momentum-building play came as a result of a missed carry. The season's worst carry/doubledribble/travel. Doug Gottlieb (@GottliebShow) May 24, 2017 Lebron, how about a carry on?
