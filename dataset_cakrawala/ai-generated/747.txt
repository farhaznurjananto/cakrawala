The crowd stopped traffic in front of Serbia's parliament and threw eggs at the building while yelling "We don't want you, Vucic!" and "Vucic is a crook!" The demonstrators then proceeded past the building of the public broadcaster RTS and made their way to the headquarters of the state Election Commission, RIK, and the government building before returning to the parliament building. Protesters gathered after social media posts alleged that supporters of Prime Minister Vucic had stolen the poll on Sunday, giving him an overwhelming victory over a number of opposition candidates and preventing a second round. Tuesday will see additional demonstrations in the southern city of Nis, as well as in Belgrade. Sunday's election was decisively won by Vucic, who received around 54.9% of the votes cast, according to unofficial figures. Nonetheless, the opposition asserted that significant electoral violations occurred, including media silencing and voter intimidation. In the northern city of Novi Sad, approximately a thousand individuals gathered to accuse the administration of electoral fraud. "That the elections were manipulated is common knowledge. At 8 p.m. [when the polling stations closed], they began to congratulate [Vucic]. How could this be? We must defend each other since we no longer have institutions "Novi Sad protester Lazar Covs told the Beta news agency. Facebook was used to organize protests "Against the Tyranny" with the phrase "The first fight in the war for a better future has begun." The event notice stated, "It's time to use the Internet to organize a free voice and a genuine sense that we can make a difference."
