Six red states that are rapidly becoming green Are Marijuana Reforms Close at Hand? Ed Rogers, a columnist for the Washington Post and former Republican strategist, urged the party to take a hard stance against liberalizing marijuana laws in response to President Obama's recent admission that cannabis is less dangerous than alcohol. "Republicans must be transparent," he wrote in a January 20 commentary. "Marijuana use has no positive or productive effects. Republican leaders should state this, as the president will not." Not if they are actively seeking votes. Recent statewide polls indicate that marijuana law reform is still a popular issue among voters, and not just in states that are stereotypically 'blue' Here is an overview of several red states that are rapidly becoming "green." Arizona Arizona is the only state in the United States that classifies first-time marijuana possession offenses as felonies punishable by up to two years in prison. In spite of the fact that the state has the sixteenth highest arrest rate per capita for marijuana possession, the majority of state legislators continue to oppose marijuana law reform, their constituents are more than willing to do so. 56% of Arizonans support the legalization of marijuana for adults, according to May polling data. (A separate Public Policy Poll conducted in January of last year found that 59 percent of Grand Canyon State voters would support an initiative to regulate marijuana like alcohol.) At least one representative of the state is listening. This session, Democratic lawmaker Ruben Gallego is supporting legislation to legalize the cultivation and retail sale of the plant. The proposal faces a steep uphill battle. In 2012, Republican Governor Jan Brewer filed a lawsuit to halt the implementation of the state's medical marijuana law, which was approved by voters in 2010. (In the end, a federal court denied Brewer's request.) Georgia In 2010, nearly 33,000 Georgians were arrested for marijuana possession, the sixth highest number in the nation. According to a newly-released statewide Public Policy Poll, however, a majority of Georgia voters would prefer that number to be reduced to zero. 54 percent of Georgians, according to a January PPP poll, support "changing state law to regulate and tax marijuana similarly to alcohol." Five-seven percent of Georgians surveyed support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes. And 62 percent of voters support amending state law to make possession offenses a civil offense punishable by a fine of up to $100, but not by imprisonment. Possession of any amount of cannabis is a criminal misdemeanor under current law, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Following the release of the poll, some state legislators have expressed interest in forming a study committee to examine various options for allowing the herb's medical use, including the availability of high CBD, low THC strains of the plant. Indiana 52% of Hoosiers believe that cannabis should be regulated similarly to alcohol, according to statewide polling data released by Ball State University in December. 54% of Indiana voters support replacing the state's current criminal penalties for marijuana possession with civil fines. It is understandable why the majority of Hoosiers support such legal reforms. In Indiana, marijuana possession for the first time is considered a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine. According to the FBI, police made nearly 13,000 arrests for minor marijuana possession violations in 2010. Legislation sponsored by Democrats to decriminalize the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana is currently pending before the Senate. However, the Republican governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, has spoken out against reforming the state's cannabis penalties, calling the plant a "gateway drug." Louisiana Louisiana has among the harshest marijuana offense penalties in the south. However, while state legislators may publicly support harsh penalties for marijuana, their constituents do not. 53% of voters believe that cannabis should be legalized, taxed, and regulated, according to data released by Public Policy Polling last fall. 56% of voters support decriminalization of the plant, and 65% support legalization of its medical use. In spite of this, last year, senators voted against legislation that would have modified the penalties for repeat marijuana possession offenders. (Under the current law, repeat marijuana offenders could face up to five years in prison and a $2,000 fine. The maximum sentence for repeat offenders is 20 years in prison! This year, Democrats have reintroduced legislation to address the state's harsh marijuana possession penalties. According to the state Department of Corrections, 1,372 Louisianians are serving sentences for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The average sentence is 8.4 years and there are 10 individuals serving life sentences. Oklahoma Oklahoma's marijuana laws are among the harshest in the nation. Under state law, possession of marijuana is punishable by up to one year in prison for a first offense and up to ten years in prison for subsequent offenses. The sale of marijuana is punishable by life in prison.
