Psychiatrists, known for their stoic demeanor, are required to remain emotionally detached while they delve into the complex, and often painful, issues of their patients. Prof Richard Green of Imperial College in London, an expert in the mental health field, recalled breaking down and shedding tears just once in his 40-year career while listening to an Irishman recount the abuse he suffered as a child at the hands of Christian Brothers.

It's crucial to remember that dwelling on the victims' pain may not necessarily aid their recovery, as Mannix Flynn, an advocate for abuse survivors, points out the potential danger of sentimentalizing them.

One of the challenges faced is how to address religious congregations that appear unable to comprehend their institutional responsibility for such heinous crimes. To understand this issue, let's consider a real-world example.

The state is currently committed to constructing a single national children's hospital within the Mater Misericordiae complex in Dublin, subjecting it to the control of the Sisters of Mercy. As per the ownership structure, both the Mater and the national children's hospital will be run according to the mission and traditions of the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in Ireland.

These traditions consist of both commendable and egregious practices, such as running institutions like Goldenbridge, where children were subjected to systematic abuse and mistreatment, and Cappoquin Industrial School, which was plagued with dysfunctional management well into the 1980s.

Moreover, an equally troubling issue is the persistent denial and minimization of abuse when testimonies come to light. Such denial is embodied by Sr Helena O'Donoghue, who shockingly remained adamant that extreme violence and daily unjustified physical abuse were nonexistent at Goldenbridge, asserting that it was a "reasonably effective and caring institution."

As we move forward in the 21st century, a poignant question arises: is it acceptable for institutions that cannot comprehend their obligation to avoid further harm to remain the trustees of our educational and healthcare facilities?

Last week, we discovered that the Department of Education has failed to respond to a request by the parents' group Educate Together for recognition as a patron for second-level schoolsâ€”a request that has been pending for 15 months. In addition, Catholic bishops have requested co-patronage of new, non-Catholic state primary schools, exhibiting no change in their demands for control.

In a heartfelt testimony, a priest who ran the infamous school in Daingean recalled a turning point while listening to the beating of a student and praying to Christ: "Christ himself is being punished now right beside me." No longer should our institutions be allowed to "crucify Christ" by perpetuating this persistent cycle of abuse and denial. It is time for a change.
