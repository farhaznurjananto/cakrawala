The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) and Mayor Rahm Emanuel are working diligently to secure funding for the Red and Purple Modernization Project (RPM) before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It is anticipated that support for urban transit projects may become harder to come by under the new administration, considering Trump's electoral base comprises mostly of rural and suburban residents, many of whom are not inclined towards public transit. Additionally, Trump has chosen a road lobbyist to lead his transportation transition team.

State legislation passed recently allows Chicago to create tax-increment districts for four specific transit projects. Unlike conventional TIF districts, this new legislation prohibits the transit TIF zones from diverting any funding away from Chicago Public Schools. Under the Obama administration, it is likely that the U.S. Department of Transportation would provide $1 billion in funding to cover 50% of the RPM project cost. This could be granted through a "Core Capacity" grant, a funding source established for expanding capacity on pre-existing transit systems.

As part of the RPM project, the CTA plans to rebuild the Red and Purple Line tracks between Lawrence and Bryn Mawr in Phase 1 and extend from Bryn Mawr to Howard in a future phase. In the first phase, signal upgrades and the construction of a flyover track north of the Belmont station would take place, which would help eliminate conflicts between Red, Purple, and Brown Line trains, thus increasing capacity. Additionally, the CTA would rebuild four stations: Lawrence, Argyle, Berwyn, and Bryn Mawr.

While Trump has not explicitly stated that he would cut transit funding, his transportation policies remain ambiguous. Although the official Republican party platform calls for the federal government to cease funding transit, Trump has not committed to this. He has mentioned intentions to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure over a decade, encompassing all types of transportation. However, politicians and experts have expressed doubts about the feasibility of his proposed funding mechanism.

The CTA would be eligible for Core Capacity funding if it submits an application by November 30. The RPM transit TIF district is projected to generate approximately $623 million over its 35-year lifespan, which would be used to repay a federal loan covering matching funds for the $1 billion Core Capacity grant. The improved transit service created by the RPM project would increase property values in surrounding neighborhoods, generating additional property tax revenue.

In compliance with the transit TIF law, the Chicago Public Schools would receive the same portion of this additional revenue as they would if the transit TIF district did not exist. The transit TIF would receive 80% of the remaining increment money, with other taxing bodies receiving 20%.

However, before the CTA can submit its funding application for the RPM project by the November 30 deadline, approval for the transit TIF from three local authorities is required. The Community Development Commission will hold a meeting to approve the TIF district, followed by the Chicago Plan Commission voting on the proposed transit TIF's approval. Lastly, the City Council's zoning committee will vote on the TIF.

While 43rd Ward alder Michele Smith has opposed the district's boundaries, thousands of daily CTA commuters living in the area will directly benefit from the improvements. The RPM project would enhance the reliability of transit service north of Belmont, eliminate track-crossing delays with the Belmont flyover, allow the CTA to add more rush-hour trains to alleviate overcrowding, and make four stations ADA accessible, providing new travel options for people with disabilities. The increased reliability, capacity, and accessibility would benefit not only the residents but also merchants along the entire Red Line.

The full City Council's vote on the TIF has not been determined yet. Mayor Emanuel would have to call a special session, as the next regularly scheduled council meeting is imminent.
