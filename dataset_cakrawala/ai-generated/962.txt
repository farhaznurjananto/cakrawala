As part of a campaign against albino ritual killings, Tanzanian police announced on Friday that they had detained 32 sorcerers this week. According to activists, at least 75 albinos have been murdered in an east African country since 2000 so that their limbs and other body parts might be used as amulets to ensure success in love, life, and business. President Jakaya Kikwete swore last week to eradicate the practice, which he said brought shame to the east African nation, while albino activists called on authorities to kill those convicted of the crimes on Friday. Tanzania outlaws witchdoctors in an effort to stop the killing of albinos. Read further Joseph Konyo, the police commander of the northwestern town of Geita, informed reporters that the witch doctors were apprehended with a variety of things, including potions and oil from an unknown source. He did not indicate whether they had been charged or apprehended with anything related to albinos, a condition characterized by the absence of pigmentation in the skin, eyes, and hair. Seventeen convicted murderers, including four condemned to death on Thursday, are currently on death row, although Tanzania has not carried out an execution in twenty years. Ernest Kimaya, the chairman of the Tanzania Albinism Society, told Reuters, "We want all those guilty of murdering people with albinism to be executed immediately in order to send a clear message that these acts will no longer be accepted." "We made this direct request to the president during our meeting with him this week, and he assured us that the government will speed the execution of death row inmates convicted of similar murders." Kimaya stated that the members feared that the attacks, which have been on the rise recently, will become even more frequent in the run-up to the October elections, as some politicians resorted to witch doctors to boost their chances of victory. "There is a correlation between elections and an increase in violence against those with albinism. This is something of which we are aware "Kimaya remarked. Albinos are viewed similarly in other African societies. Yet, activists assert such attacks are especially widespread in Tanzania. The home affairs minister, Mathias Chikawe, told Reuters the president had to give a written consent for an execution to be carried out.
