Tesla Model 3 pre-orders are getting close to 400,000. What kind of animal is the Tesla Model 3? Perhaps both. But we'll talk about that soon. First some big news. According to Electrek*, "Yesterday, Diarmuid O'Connell, vice president of business development at Tesla, was in Amsterdam for the AVERE E-mobility Conference. O'Connell now says that "close to 400,000 people" have already made reservations for the car." O'Connell said this about the Model 3: "It sends a message to the industry that there's a huge demand for great electric vehicles." Tesla Motors is the source. Electrek reports: "Someone in the crowd said that the unveiling of the Model 3 was a "huge success" and then asked how Tesla was going to deliver on all those pre-orders. O'Connell replied, "As of right now, it's a success." The real success will be making a great product and selling it in the quantities that are possible and needed. He then said what CEO Elon Musk had said about his plans to make more cars... He said that Tesla had learned a lot from making the Model S and starting to make the Model X. They will use this information to move faster to higher volumes. O'Connell also said that after the Model 3, Tesla plans to add more cars to its lineup."

In fact, an observer at the Huffington Post predicted this would happen before the Model 3's launch, saying: "Tesla's Model 3 might be half-affordable and way too cool at the same time, which is impossible. The Tesla Model 3 might put Tesla in the business of unicorns. It has a sleek body and can go for 215 miles on a single charge. It also costs less than other electric cars, so more people can afford it." See the chart below for how they fit together... Huffington Post is the source. Still, some Tesla watchers think that the Tesla Model 3 is a beast that will literally kill all competitors. I found this short video clip on Instagram that showed the Tesla "beast" beating up the competition... Tesla Motors UAE is the source. Umm, that was a bit... out of the ordinary. But with pre-orders for the Tesla Model 3 getting close to 400,000 and the Tesla Model S recently beating its premium car competitors in both the US and Europe, it's clear that traditional automakers should hide. === * Source: Electrek.
