Vance Bourjaily, a man of letters, was not recognized with top ranks despite being famous for his novel, The End of My Life. Although not achieving it, he lived a long and successful life in writing letters, editing, and teaching. Bourjaily was a literary socialite and hosted parties that famous writers such as Norman Mailer, James Jones, and William Styron attended.

Men and women of letters were a powerful force in literature. They were the workhorses who kept the literary enterprise moving by forming committees, juries, giving awards, holding readings, and receptions, and writing critical essays for obscure quarterlies. Furthermore, alcohol was the solvent of their trade, they were never to miss a literary event, and their universe was held together by one object, the book, sold in one specific place, the bookstore.

What made men and women of letters reign supreme was the aura of their authority. The Book-of-the-Month Club in its founding year sought to assure readers of book worthiness by appointing five judges consisting of high-profile literary mandarins. This club steadily increased awareness of American literature by introducing different authors such as Ellen Glasgow, Sinclair Lewis, and Pear S. Buck to American homes, and it even introduced foreign authors to America, such as Sigrid Undset and Isak Dinesen.

Today, the apparatus that supported that world has collapsed. The little bookstores where writers once dropped in to chat have been replaced by big bookstores, and even Barnes & Noble itself is closing down its popular New York branch near Lincoln Center. On today's landscape, there are only few men and women of letters visible, such as Larry McMurty, who is a proprietor of Booked Up, one of America's prominent used-book stores, and Dave Eggers, the writer and founder of literary journal McSweeney's and DVD Wholphin, which showcase outstanding short documentary films that would get little exposure otherwise.

As a writer, the future of royalties in electronic books worried Paul Theroux, and his publisher was not certain if the increase in electronic book sales would affect hardcover sales. But, such technological advancements have revolutionized publishing and made books more accessible to everyone. Therefore, despite the changes, literature continues to thrive and remains significant.
