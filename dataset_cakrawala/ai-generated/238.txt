After the recent UK election, Remainers are now looking for ways to influence the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Former ministers and lobby groups are making moves to ensure their voices are heard. One option being considered is forming a commission or group of advisers from different political parties and businesses, to work towards a more open approach.

Senior Tories, including the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, have also commented that a Conservative Brexit is not enough. But even ministers who support Brexit understand that a minority government has to behave differently, and take a more consensual approach.

While the government may push for a softer stance and try to maximise access to the single market, leaving the single market is unlikely to be reversed; as both major parties supported this during the election process. Also, politicians are not likely to backtrack on their promises to end free movement, since over 80% of the public voted for parties that support this.

The DUP may have an influence in government, but they are not “soft” Brexiteers and will not work towards watering down the Brexit process. However, the government is aware of the need to listen to other parties more since it is now more vulnerable to Eurosceptic backbenchers.

It is not yet clear if the government will establish a cross-party Brexit commission. While a commission such as this could help Theresa May’s appearance of inclusivity, it is uncertain if it will actually achieve its goals since similar committees in the past have not accomplished much.

Although Theresa May may be more vulnerable to other parties, she is not prone to reaching out. Cross-party working will be a key feature of the government, but it will take time to find out how it is executed, and whether a new process will be introduced.
