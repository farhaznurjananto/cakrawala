Disarming America

By Thomas Sowell  http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | A man in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, opened fire on the audience, killing at least a dozen people. This tragedy has been met with shock by many people and with soul-searching by others.

What we are not seeing is a soul-searching about why we have laws that make it possible for a crazy person like this to arm himself for mass murder.

The amendment is not about hunting. It is not about target practice. It is not about self-defense. It is about an armed army capable of overthrowing the government.

The amendment was written in 1791, before there were any guns in America. Back then, colonial Americans were fighting the British army. They needed an
