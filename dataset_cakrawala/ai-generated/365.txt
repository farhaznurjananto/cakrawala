A campaign has been created in New York City to counter a controversial ad that is set to appear on the city's subway system. Comedians Negin Farsad and Dean Obeidallah created the “Fighting-Bigotry-with-Delightful-Posters” campaign as a response to the planned “anti-jihad” advertisements sponsored by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an organisation co-founded by Pamela Geller. One of Geller’s ads, which a judge ruled was protected under free speech, features an image of a man wearing a kefiyah with the text, “Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah” and “That’s His Jihad. What’s Yours?”.

Farsad and Obeidallah co-directed the 2013 film, The Muslims are Coming. They created a series of posters that include one with the message, “The Ugly Truth About Muslims: Muslims have great frittata recipes.” Although the campaign was sparked by Geller’s creation, Farsad said that the posters are designed to counter the way in which Muslims are typically portrayed in the media. She says that 99% of the coverage of Muslims is negative, with “absolutely little-to-no counter-narrative”, and the campaign aims to offer a humorous alternative. “We want your racist uncle to see you with a photo with one of our posters. And maybe he’ll laugh? Is it possible? I think it is possible!”, Farsad said.

The posters were crowdfunded via a PayPal button on the campaign’s website. Almost $20,000 was raised from more than 400 donors to print the posters. Obeidallah believes that the campaign is not political and therefore will not breach new MTA regulations banning all political subway ads. “Our ads were approved and printed,” he said. “Our ads are not political in any way. They are more akin to public service announcements.”

Muslims in the US are often only given a voice in the context of terrorism. Farsad and Obeidallah wanted to use humour to counter these negative connotations. “Muslims can be funny,” said Farsad, “which is something most people don’t know”.
