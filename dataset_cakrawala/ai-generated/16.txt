SAN FRANCISCO—Google lawyer Robert Van Nest on Tuesday argued that the company is entitled to a summary judgment, with the argument that Oracle cannot prove that Android infringed on its Java patents.

If Judge William Alsup grants Google's motion, it will be a major setback to Oracle's suit against Google. Oracle has already suffered two setbacks in the trial—a ruling that it could not copyright the Java APIs, and a partial ruling that the APIs were not covered under Google's fair use defense.

Van Nest argued that Oracle's patent claims are invalid because they are based on technology that was previously patented.

"They're just double-dipping," Van Nest said.

He also argued that Oracle cannot prove that Google infringed on its patents because the company did not produce any evidence that Google knew of Oracle's patents.

"There's no evidence that Google knew of the patents," Van Nest said.

Oracle lawyer Peter Bicks countered that Google knew of the patents because it had access to Oracle's Java code.

"Google had access to the Java code. They knew of the patents," Bicks said.

Bicks also argued that Oracle can prove that Google infringed on its patents because the company's Android operating system contains code that is similar to the patented code.

"Google copied the code," Bicks said.

Oracle is seeking $9.3 billion in damages from Google.

The trial is scheduled to resume Wednesday.
