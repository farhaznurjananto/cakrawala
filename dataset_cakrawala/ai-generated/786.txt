Gerard Pique says he feels inferior to Real Madrid for the first time since joining Barcelona after the latter won the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday. First-half goals from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema, combined with a 3-1 victory at Camp Nou on Sunday, saw Madrid cruise to a 5-1 aggregate victory, securing the club's seventh trophy under Zidane. Pique, who was injured in the second half and will be tested on Thursday, later admitted that Barcelona is struggling both on and off the field. "It's the first time in my nine years [at Barcelona] that I feel inferior to Madrid," Pique told reporters after the defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu. "We're not having the best season as a team or as a club. We should all be as close to each other as possible and move forward. Gerard Pique could only watch as Real Madrid cruised to the Super Cup title. "We must accept this defeat and accept that Madrid is better than us [at the moment], but the season is long and there is still time to improve." Meanwhile, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde admitted that the club has been rocked by a preseason in which they lost Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros. "There will always be difficulties [in football]," Valverde said at the postgame press conference. "You can get into trouble in three days. Things happened during preseason that impacted the team's balance, which we must correct or work on to find another balance." There is nothing left for us to do but recover our spirits and look forward. What we need to do is win, because victory changes everything." ESPN FC's Samuel Marsden covers Barcelona.
