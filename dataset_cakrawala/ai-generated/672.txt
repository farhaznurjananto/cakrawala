Welcome Aboard: Czechoslovakia Joins the Fray

Version 9.13 unveils 10 new vehicles from the 8th nation to join World of the Tanks – Czechoslovakia. Some of these vehicles might seem familiar, particularly in the lower Tiers. However, the higher Tiers introduce fresh gameplay dynamics that could shake up the established hierarchy in Tier X battles. Bat Chats, take notice!

Immerse Yourself in the New Map: Pilsen

To complement the introduction of the Czechoslovakian tech tree, we're also adding a new map – Pilsen. Inspired by a real town in Czechoslovakia, Pilsen perfectly captures the essence of the update. The town was renowned for its heavy industry and factories, utilized under German occupation to produce countless tanks and armored vehicles for the Wehrmacht.

This historical context is beautifully reflected in Pilsen's design. You'll battle amidst a devastated industrial complex, surrounded by enormous halls, production lines, and warehouses reduced to ruins. The battlefield provides a unique experience, offering a variety of tactical possibilities: from orchestrating daring assaults on the enemy team to setting ambushes for unsuspecting tanks.

Pilsen will be available for both Random and Rampage battles. Get ready to dive into this captivating new environment and explore the tactical opportunities it offers!
