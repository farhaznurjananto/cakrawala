Michael Rapaport is known for his strong opinions and he didn’t hold back on LaVar Ball, the father of the Ball brothers — Lonzo, LaMelo and LiAngelo — who have been accused of shoplifting while in China. Rapaport commented on this situation in an Instagram video.

“LaVar Ball is the worst father,” he said. “You’re the worst father in the world. I would like to know if you’re that stupid, were you that stupid in school? What grade did you finish? 10th? What was your GPA? D minus?”

He added that Ball “is the worst example for black fathers.”

“What kind of example are you setting for black fathers? That you don’t give a f— about your kids? You’re not a father. You’re an idiot.”

He added, “You’re a f—ing idiot. Your kids are going to suffer because of you and they’re going to suffer for a long time.”

Rapaport’s comments come after Ball said his sons didn’t steal anything and that he was “very proud” of them.

Ball has since apologized for his comments.

“My sons have been caught up in a legal matter and I have been made aware of some of the comments that have been made about them,” Ball said in a statement. “My sons are young men and I know they will be able to overcome this. I am very proud of them and will support them through this difficult time.”

The Ball brothers have been accused of shoplifting while in China and are currently in China to try and resolve the situation. They have been suspended from UCLA and are expected to return to the U.S. later this week.
