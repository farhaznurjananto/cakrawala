Newcastle United are set to continue their game of brinkmanship with Liverpool in regards to a possible transfer for Andy Carroll. Alan Pardew, manager of Newcastle, expressed that he would want the striker to be in his squad, but that the deal was not down to him. He also stated that although a move for Carroll is not as likely at the moment, he did not rule out the possibility of it still happening. 

Pardew is concentrating on the Europa League qualifiers and expressed his desire to win something with the team he has. He also suggested that the best route for the club to grow would be to qualify for the Champions League. With this in mind, he has been attempting to strengthen the squad with signings such as Mathieu Debuchy and Douglas. 

Despite the focus on improving the team, Pardew is also keen to retain the current key players, such as Cheik Tiote, Fabricio Coloccini and Yohan Cabaye. He stated that he would be content to move forward with the current squad, but that they are watching the market for potential targets.
