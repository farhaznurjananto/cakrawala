The original 1996 Crash Bandicoot had a colour palette of around 32 colours, but the PS4 version uses more than 10 million.

“The original game had a colour palette of around 32 colours, whereas the PS4 version uses more than 10 million colours,” says Chris Johnston, executive producer on the PS4 version.

“This is one of the things that we’re most proud of – that we’ve managed to retain the original game’s feel while bringing it into the modern era.”

The game has been completely rebuilt from the ground up, with new levels, new graphics and a new soundtrack.

“We’ve completely rebuilt the game from the ground up,” says Johnston.

“We’ve added new levels, new graphics and a brand new soundtrack.

“We’ve also added a host of new features, including a save system, a pause menu and a map.”

The PS4 version of the game will also include a number of new trophies and achievements.

The game is set to launch on June 30th, 2017.
