Welcome to the latest edition of our Fantasy Premier League (FPL) podcast! As we approach the busy festive period, we're back with the first of a trilogy of remote episodes. In this episode, we delve into a range of topics that have been on the minds of FPL enthusiasts. From the emergence of midfielders, rotation strategies, cover options, and the potential of Chelsea players, we've got you covered.

We know how important it is to stay ahead of the game in FPL, and that's why we're here to provide you with valuable insights and advice. So, join us on this week's episode as we discuss the best tactics to employ as we head into Gameweek 13. 

As usual, we start the podcast with some exciting features that have become fan favorites. This episode marks the return of Nyomwatch and psychology corner, where we explore the psychological aspects of FPL management. We also take time to answer community questions, giving you a chance to have your voice heard on the podcast.

However, we do have to apologize for Tom's snottiness - he's currently battling man flu, but we're powering through to bring you a top-notch podcast. 

If you missed our previous episode, we discussed the Daft Punk theme that dominated last week's FPL discussions. We had an exciting time exploring the unique ways FPL enthusiasts expressed their love for the legendary French duo. 

Looking ahead to the next few weeks, we have some updates about the podcast schedule. We'll be back after Gameweek 15, with Tom heading off to Singapore on Thursday. Unfortunately, we won't be able to produce an episode midweek due to Tom's travel schedule.
