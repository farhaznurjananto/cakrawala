Alberta's government is cracking down on lending companies and  so-called "extortion" practices. 
 The new legislation means Alberta will move from one of the highest interest rates in the country to one of the lowest. 
 Currently, payday loan companies in this state can charge $23 per $100 loan. 
  The proposed law to stop predatory lending will lower the fee to $15 and give customers  at least 42 days to get their money back  before  interest starts accumulating. 
  Alberta Services Minister Stephanie McLean said the law would best help low-income Albertans. 
 "Currently lenders are able to charge very high interest rates to Albertans who are the least able to afford it," McLean said in the legislature Thursday.

 "This bill will reduce the high cost of borrowing for payday loans and help ensure that alternative financial assistance and short term credit options are available to all Albertans." 
 
 Experts say payday loan customers are often the working poor. The annual percentage rate on some of these loans can work out to 600 per cent. 
  Officials say the bill could bring that rate down to a range of 88 to 130 per cent.  Jeff Loomis of Momentum, an organization that works with low-income Calgary residents, said another proposed change that would allow borrowers to pay off their loans in installments would go a long way. 
 Momentum's Jeff Loomis said the payback could be high.
