The GX-M1 may not be the ultimate gaming mouse, but it certainly offers features that go beyond those of a normal 2-button mouse. This article will provide a detailed review of the GX-M1 mouse's design, laser tracking system, weave cord, LED lights, and scroll wheel, among other features.

Design-wise, the GX-M1 has a sleek and modern appearance that most gamers might appreciate. Its ergonomics adjust well to average-sized hands, fitting comfortably into the palm. However, some users complain that the left side buttons can be easily triggered by the resting thumb, which may bother some gamers.

The left and right mouse buttons are designed to provide a cozy experience, with a concave curve that accommodates finger placement to increase grip when holding the mouse. Furthermore, users will enjoy the low amount of pressure required to click the buttons, a feature that prevents accidental clicks. If you rest your palm while clicking, you can comfortably click almost halfway up the mouse, providing added leverage.

As for the laser tracking system, it works great on solid surfaces such as desks and mouse pads, delivering optimal results, but it is not ideal for soft or mesh surfaces like a fabric sofa, where it does not respond as accurately.

One unique feature of the GX-M1 mouse is its USB cord. It has a woven texture similar to a rope that is an exclusive design, providing extra durability and security for your device. Although the cord's weave does not affect compatibility or functionality, it adds an appealing aesthetic look to the mouse.

Another fascinating feature is the LED lights on the top and sides of the mouse. It glows in bright, vibrant colors that add to its modern and cool appearance. Beneath the mouse is a switch that allows users to control the LED lights. While it does not add anything to the device's functionality, it still offers a nice and interesting touch.

The only con you may encounter is the scroll wheel. Its central position is off, causing it to get stuck from time to time. To fix this, you have to push it to the right or left side, depending on the error. This can be compared to sliding doors that get stuck when it falls out of the groove, which can be frustrating for some users.

However, this minor design flaw should not take away from the mouse's overall excellent performance. It's an affordable, dependable, and well-designed mouse that comes with a protective pouch, making it an ideal choice for gamers who desire functionality and quality.

In conclusion, the GX-M1 mouse may not be the ultimate gaming mouse, but it provides excellent features that surpasses the traditional 2-button mouse. Its design, weave cord, LED lights, and laser tracking system are impressive, offering users an excellent experience, with its minor scroll wheel flaw being the only downside. If you're looking for a reliable gaming mouse, the GX-M1 should be on your list of options.
