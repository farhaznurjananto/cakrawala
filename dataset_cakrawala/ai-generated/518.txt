San Francisco, July 12th, 2013 - Independent game developer Reptile Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of their customizable fighting game, Megabyte Punch, on August 6th. Described as a combination of SSB, Megaman, and Custom Robo, Megabyte Punch is an electro fighting/beat 'em up game in which players can build and customize their own character. The game will be available on the Humble Store for $14.99 (US) or currency equivalent for PC (Windows), Mac, and Linux. Megabyte Punch has already garnered attention as one of "The Most Anticipated Indie Games of 2013" by IndieGameMagazine and is currently seeking votes on Steam Greenlight to be available on that platform.

Megabyte Punch offers a story mode where players battle various creatures to collect parts and upgrade their fighter, by acquiring abilities such as gun arms for shooting or powerful hips for a devastating pelvic thrust attack. With their customized fighter, players can compete in tournaments or battle against other players in destructible arenas. The multiplayer battle mode allows players to challenge others in destructible arenas with their customized creatures' abilities, and the tournament offers the chance to win rare new parts for their character. Additionally, players can create their own versus levels using an external image editor and import them into the game for endless fun.

Key Features of the full game include:

- Chunky, stylish graphics
- Six unique electro-worlds with boss fights
- Over 150 parts to collect and endless combinations to customize your character
- Pumpin' electro soundtrack
- Tournament competition for rare parts
- Up to 4 player local co-op and versus mode
