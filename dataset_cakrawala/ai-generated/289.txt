Ulf Poschardt, the editor-in-chief of Die Welt, one of Germany's leading right-wing newspapers, took to Twitter on Christmas Day, accusing Germany’s Christmas midnight masses of having left-wing bias. In his tweet, he asked, “Who would voluntarily go to a midnight mass if at the end of the sermon he thinks he spent the evening with the Jusos or the Green youth?”. The Jusos and Green youth are the youth organisations of Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Green party, respectively, both of which represent the left-wing of centrist parties.

Poschardt’s tweet came a few days after Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), had criticised churches for becoming “too political” in an interview with Focus magazine. It is not clear which Christmas mass Poschardt attended, or if he was referring to a specific one at all. However, many of the Christmas messages delivered by German church leaders this year included calls for solidarity with refugees, opposition to the commercialisation of Christmas, and opposition to property speculation.

It is worth noting that Poschardt once declared himself a supporter of Germany's pro-business Free Democratic Party. Therefore, messages discussing solidarity with refugees, opposition to commercialisation, and opposition to property speculation, would undoubtedly irritate him.

The fallout from Poschardt’s tweet was swift with many SPD and Green party politicians taking to Twitter to respond to the editor-in-chief's criticism. The chairwoman of the Green party, Simone Peter, tweeted in response, "Then maybe I really should go to a midnight mass again. Sounds good. And we need intervention more than ever with inequality, marginalization, and climate crisis." Meanwhile, Ricarda Lang, spokesperson for the Green youth organisation, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, “I think it's fairly telling that it seems to annoy him extremely when humanity and solidarity are represented in church. For us, humanity is a task for the whole of society, for Ulf Poschardt, it seems altruism is a leftist-green-infected fad for Jusos and the Green youth."

Poschardt did not respond to a request for comment by DW. However, he did respond to the criticism on Twitter by claiming that the backlash was “a march of the sanctimonious” and that only “the right people” understood his tweet. His comments sparked Twitter users to mock him under the hashtag “PoschardtEvangelium” or “Poschardt’s gospel”. The tweets inspired people to imagine Bible episodes from a capitalist perspective.

A spokesperson for the German Protestant Church organisation dismissed Poschardt's statements, stating that his "distorted image is not in any way a fair reflection of the reality of tens of thousands of Christmas sermons all over Germany". He argued that being “pious” often requires taking a stand on political issues.

To conclude, the criticism aimed at Poschardt highlights the ongoing debate around the involvement of religious institutions, especially churches, in political issues. While some argue that churches should refrain from taking positions on political issues, others argue that human rights or social justice issues and morality are, to a great extent, intertwined.
