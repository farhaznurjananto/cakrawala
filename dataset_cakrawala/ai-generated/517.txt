Two of the San Francisco Giants' most promising young prospects, outfielder Heliot Ramos and third baseman Jacob Gonzalez, are making a name for themselves in the rookie-level Arizona League after being drafted earlier this summer. Both players have been garnering attention, including video interviews with on-air host Sande Charles. Below, we delve into each player's performance in the Arizona League matches in the past week.

Heliot Ramos, an outfielder for the San Francisco Giants, has started his professional career with remarkable stats, hitting .342/.389/.624/1.013 over 117 at-bats, with eight doubles, five triples, and five home runs in his opening 29 games. Despite struggling with strikeouts and overaggressiveness, the 17-year-old Puerto Rican is showing great adaptability in his transition to professional baseball. Ramos' athletic talent allows him to excel in center-field, with foot speed, arm strength, and athleticism that could see him move to right or left field depending on how his bat develops. His potential for growth indicates he may become a key part of the Giants' outfield in the coming seasons.

Jacob Gonzalez, a third baseman for the San Francisco Giants, is a high school player with college-level composure, patience, and maturity. Perhaps influenced by his father, former Major League Baseball star Luis Gonzalez, Jacob demonstrates impressive strike-zone reading and decision-making at the plate. Showcasing noteworthy power, Gonzalez has the potential to become a significant corner infield threat as he matures. Gonzalez's physical build and batting ability could lead to a transition to first base or left field, depending on the development of his glove and arm strength.
