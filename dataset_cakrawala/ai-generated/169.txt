In Argentina, sex change surgery becomes legal.

In Argentina, sex change surgery becomes legal. This means that people who wish to have surgery to change their physical sex will be able to do so without having to go through a lengthy legal process. The new law is seen as a victory for transgender rights in the country. Previously, transgender individuals had to go through a long and arduous legal process in order to have surgery. This process could often times take years, and transgender people who did not have the money to wait could often times be forced to live as the opposite sex without any legal recognition. With the new law, transgender people will no longer have to go through a long and difficult process to change their legal sex. Instead, they can just go to a hospital and have the surgery done. This will make life much easier for transgender people in Argentina, and will hopefully help to increase the overall acceptance of transgender people in the country.
