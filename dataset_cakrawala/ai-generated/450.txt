In theScore's comprehensive team previews, Justin Bourne and Thomas Drance seek to identify unique elements that set each team apart from the rest. In this particular piece, they dive into the ongoing debate surrounding one of the Winnipeg Jets' key players, Dustin Byfuglien - should he be a forward or a defenseman? The conundrum poses interesting questions for the Jets' coaching staff, as Byfuglien's versatility mirrors a similar situation with Brent Burns of the San Jose Sharks. 

Byfuglien has consistently shown the ability to contribute significantly to the Jets' success, whether as a forward or a defenseman. In fact, his adaptability has proven to be a significant asset to the team. However, it's worth exploring which position brings out the best in him and provides the most value to the organization.

As a Forward:
Dustin Byfuglien shines as a forward, particularly when creating havoc for opposing teams' defenses. His size and strength enable him to physically overpower opponents and generate scoring opportunities. Additionally, he established a strong partnership with Blake Wheeler last year that proved fruitful for the Jets. Nevertheless, Byfuglien's puck-centric playing style can create issues for the rest of the team, as his focus on the puck sometimes forces his teammates to scramble to cover his position.

As a Defenseman:
Dustin Byfuglien also exhibits crucial skills when playing as a defenseman. He is particularly adept at using his body positioning during physical puck battles to his team's advantage. Moreover, his puck handling and ability to clear the zone are impressive, often preventing the opposition from penetrating down his side of the ice. However, Byfuglien's occasional mental lapses can expose the Jets defensively, particularly with goaltender Ondrej Pavelec not always able to cover the resulting errors.

In conclusion, considering his effectiveness in both positions, it is evident that Byfuglien offers immense value to the Jets no matter where he plays. However, on balance, he should primarily be utilized as a defenseman. In this role, he can take control of the game, showcase a patient approach with the puck, and provide a significant offensive contribution from the back end. This offensive production from a traditionally defensive position ultimately amplifies his overall contribution to the team. While Byfuglien's flexibility will remain valuable, solidifying his role as a defenseman will enable both him and the Winnipeg Jets to maximize his talents to the fullest extent.
