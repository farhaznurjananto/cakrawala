A dinner date can still feel like work for those who work in the restaurant industry. So, when Kirsten, a 29-year-old literary agent associate, met Preston, a 26-year-old sommelier, for their date at BLT Fish in the Flatiron District, she hesitated to put him in charge of the wine selection, but Preston was a pro. Did the two OkCupid members with a compatability of 94% toast to some good times or did the date end up as sour grapes? He said: When Kirsten arrived, I was put at ease because she was totally cute, with a great smile. The conversation flowed naturally, as if we were old friends. We enjoy many of the same movies/TV shows, dining out, and even the same obscure board game, Settlers of Catan. Kirsten asked me to choose a bottle because I'm a sommelier. I initially mistyped the order and worried that I looked like a moron, but I recovered with a nice sparkling chardonnay. The food at BLT Fish was excellent. Kirsten and I were having a great time so we went to the bar across the street for one more drink, which turned into three. We've decided to go out again. Preston was seated when I arrived, so it wasn't until he stood up that I realized how tall he is. He also had a sharp sense of fashion. We hit it off right away and share many cultural references, such as our discussion of "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." The BLT Fish was delicious, and despite being off the clock, Preston chose an excellent wine. Everything was fantastic, including the bags of green-apple cotton candy we received at the end. Preston knew a speakeasy across the street, so we stayed for a few more drinks. Chivalrously, he insisted on seeing me safely into a cab before heading to the subway himself. We exchanged numbers so he can include me in a Settlers of Catan club he's starting. I had a great time with Preston and would love to hang out with him again.
