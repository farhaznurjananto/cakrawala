In April 2017, 25 hospitals and healthcare facilities in Syria were attacked and destroyed, resulting in an average of one attack every 29 hours. Shockingly, independent reports indicate that 91% of these attacks were orchestrated by either Syrian government forces or Russian troops. Many of those targeted were medical facilities in Idlib, the largest city controlled by opposition forces since the 2016 siege of Aleppo. Displaced residents fled to Idlib or the Aleppo countryside, making these medical centers crucial in providing healthcare to the vulnerable population.

These devastating attacks were analyzed and verified by the Syrian Archive and its partners: Syrians for Truth and Justice, Justice for Life, and Bellingcat. By cross-referencing open-source visual content, flight observation data, and witness statements, the organizations were able to identify a sinister pattern of repeated bombardments on hospitals, an absence of warnings, and an inexplicable lack of active military hostilities during the attacks.

This joint report detailing the April 2017 atrocities committed by Syrian and Russian armed forces highlights the constant violation of the universal right to health, particularly in times of conflict. In all, eight hospitals and healthcare centers—serving over 1.3 million people—were attacked by these forces, as reported by medical facility managers and witness statements.

The report not only serves as an invaluable source of information for advocacy but also as crucial evidence for legal accountability efforts. The Syrian Archive and partners hope that their findings will bring to light the gravity of these events and fuel increased efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.

The report also identifies several ways in which it adds value to existing human rights organizations' efforts. By identifying and contextualizing visual content with witness statements and flight observation data, the report paints a clearer picture of the attacks' circumstances.

Throughout the process, consent was obtained from medical workers, facility managers, and Civil Defense volunteers regarding the public sharing of information. The report is divided into the following sections: Data Ethics, Research Methodology, Specific Attacks against Hospitals and Field Clinics, Further Research, and Errors, Corrections, and Feedback.

This report is a wake-up call to the international community to protect the fundamental right to health, particularly in times of conflict. We must work towards greater accountability for these violations and ensure that those responsible are held responsible for their actions.
