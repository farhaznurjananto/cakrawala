Fez is a game of perspective puzzles, hidden code, Escher-like architecture, and a distinct lack of signposts. But after exploring its shifting dimensions and succumbing to its mesmerizing charm, I  found that the most difficult challenge was asking me to define your experience...a sprawling, maze-like game difficult to comment on. watch me fail 
 Fez's gameplay draws core mechanics from acclaimed Nintendo classics and the golden age of home console games in general. Begin your 2D quest on a rustic floating island, aided by simplified platforming for Zelda-style exploration. Within minutes of playing the game, you are introduced to the third dimension and this is where the game really begins. The world of Fez is a series of independent floating platforms and structures. These islands appear themselves as two-dimensional planes of him, but are actually  one side of him in an imaginary cube. As you advance on simplified platforms, you can rotate the level in 90-degree increments, changing your perspective to fill gaps, reveal doors, and connect platforms. Digging deeper into the myriad aspects of Fez, other migraine-inducing techniques of all kinds affect the "shifting" mechanism. Rising water levels, rotating  parts of a single scene with levers, and invisible platforms all add to the seemingly overwhelming stillness.
