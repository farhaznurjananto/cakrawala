Flyin' Miata dual exhaust (June 2001) 
 
 Introduce 
 
 In my humble opinion, a sports car cannot be without twin exhausts. Given my choice (and a birthday in need of a great present for me :-), I went crazy and bought the best: the Flyin' Miata dual exhaust. It's not cheap (after shipping to the UK!). But oh my gosh it's awesome! 
 
 ...you can see! Its all-stainless steel construction is expected to last a long time. It certainly looks very well made, and the ends are very thick. I remember with a smile that some manufacturers painted their silencers black so they couldn't be seen - but looking at this one was almost like putting some kind of mirror under the car so  people behind could see it. can see how beautiful it is :-) 
 
 Included in the (large!) box is the exhaust pipe, 2 pages of clear and illustrated assembly instructions, as well as an additional mount and a rubber hanger. I also bought some drain sealant glue to make sure the gasket seals well. 
 Relation 
 
 It took me less than 2 hours to assemble, because I take great care to make everything perfect. The first, and probably the longest, task was to mount the car  on the axle supports, as I wasn't sure of a good placement for them and really didn't want to run over or damage the car in any way! 
 
 The next scary part  - cut a hole in the plastic bumper to accommodate the second exhaust tip. You only get the holes once, so I was  nervous! The kit includes a glue template for hole shaping, so you just measure, staple.
