In today's globally connected economy, it's essential for investors to think beyond borders, as evidenced by the upcoming earnings reports of the S&P 500 companies. For the first time since 2014, these companies are set to report impressive double-digit profit gains, and you won't want to miss out on this lucrative opportunity.

Although the "America First" policy is a primary focus for the US government, savvy investors are capitalizing on the increasingly interconnected global market. A robust earnings season supports pricey stock valuations, as demonstrated by the S&P 500, which rallied this month to its highest valuation since 2004 on a forward price-to-earnings basis.

Given that nearly half of S&P components' sales come from overseas, it's no surprise that the strengthening global economy is a welcome sight for investors. In fact, shares of the largest US companies with significant international exposure have consistently outperformed the market in recent weeks, making them a wise investment choice.

Now is the time for you, as an investor, to seize the opportunity provided by the booming global economy and ride the wave of exceptional performance from top-tier US companies. Make sure you're a part of this historical earnings season by expanding your investment horizons and embracing the power of the international market.
