The annual South Asian monsoon has caused devastating floods that have claimed the lives of 700 people with a further one million forced to flee their homes. At least 100 deaths have recently been reported in India and Bangladesh after a string of deluges since the 10th August, which were brought about when the annual monsoon hit the north and east areas of the region.

The effects of the disaster have been particularly hard-hitting within India's eastern state of Bihar. Anirudh Kumar, a leading disaster management official within the area, has confirmed that the death toll currently stands at 205, with 53 bodies retrieved as water levels start to recede in several areas. Close to 400,000 people are staying in government-run shelters, and an estimated 10 million are suffering the effects of the deluge. These floods represent the worst since 2008 when nearly 300 people were killed. 

Uttar Pradesh, another of India's states, has also witnessed catastrophe following the floods, with 69 deaths currently reported and two million residents remaining affected by the severe weather. 10,000 emergency workers and military personnel are supporting local officials in their relief and rescue operations. With nearly half of Uttar Pradesh's 75 districts hit by the floods, authorities are seeking military aid to evacuate people in at least two areas. 

The states that have been worst affected by the floods are the ones that border Nepal, which has itself faced landslides and floods that have led to 135 deaths, with a further 30 people reported missing. The United Nations has described the situation as the worst flood to plague Nepal in 15 years, with 20% of the country's 28 million people affected. 

The eastern state of West Bengal and the remote northeastern state of Assam have also suffered heavily, with huge floods leading to the confirmation of 122 deaths and nearly three million people affected. In Assam, over 450,000 people have lived in relief camps since the second wave of floods hit the state in four months. 

The extensive damage caused by the floods has affected many railways and roads. Whilst some areas have seen minor improvements, with officials stating that the situation in West Bengal is starting to progress, the issue continues to escalate in Bangladesh, where floods have resulted in 115 deaths and 5.7 million people affected. Shamim Naznin, head of the control room at the department of disaster management in Bangladesh, has shared that 31 of the country's 64 districts have been struck by floods, leading to around 300,000 people seeking refuge in makeshift shelters. 

The state flood forecasting and warning center has described the situation as the worst flood that Bangladesh has faced for over a decade, with at least 30% of the country now affected. Fortunately, the situation in the north and west of the country is improving quickly since the major rivers' levels are falling fast. 

Landslides and floods are an annual hazard that many people within South Asia are continually exposed to during the monsoon season. This year has seen one of the worst disasters of this kind, with nearly 350 people killed in the first wave of floods in mid-July in India's western states of Gujarat and Rajasthan and several northeastern states. Recently, a huge landslide in the Indian Himalayas saw two passenger buses swept off a hillside, leading toÂ 46 deaths on 13th August. Eight others, including two soldiers, lost their lives in Uttarakhand state in mid-August in landslides.
