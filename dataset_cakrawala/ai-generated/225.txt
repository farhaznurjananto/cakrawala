On September 11, Catalonia's National Day, Spanish politics took a huge hit as over 2 million people - more than a quarter of the population of Catalonia - demonstrated in the streets of Barcelona shouting one word, "independencia". It was a moment of awakening for countless Catalans from the four provinces of Catalonia in Spain's north-east who felt it was time to leave behind Spain for a state of their own.

This Catalan National Day was unlike any other as it marked the 1714 fall of a besieged Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession. The usual morning ceremonies were intertwined with a march called “Catalonia, A New European State” organised by two new nationalist networks, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and the Association of Municipalities for Independence (AMI). 

Early on, signs indicated that this march would surpass all previous rallies - around 1,200 coaches were booked to bring people in from Catalonia's regions and special trains had to be limited as the system had already run out of carriages. Even politicians who opposed Catalonia's independence, such as Josep Duran Lleida, leader of the conservative Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union (CiU) in the Spanish parliament, had to be present at the protest, despite disagreement with the cause. 

The Catalan government directed key state institutions to support the event and notorious police minister Felip Puig, who had made the headlines with his violent suppression of protesters, actively helped to build the event. The march was even covered live across Catalan state TV’s Channel 3.

The motive of the CiU government was to have the march serve as a show of support for its proposed "fiscal pact" with the central Spanish government of the Popular Party’s (PP) Mariano Rajoy. This pact, supported by all Catalan parliamentary parties, with the exception of the Socialist Party of Catalonia and the Popular Party of Catalonia, would create powers to levy taxes and decide what proportion should be forwarded to the central Spanish government. This would enable Catalonia to reverse a situation where it loses €16 billion a year to “Madrid” and the 16 other autonomous communities (states) that make up the Spanish state.

The event drew in the attendance of the entire Catalonia, from remote Pyrenean villages to the towns along the river Ebro where families had marched with placards calling for “independence now!”. Delegations arrived from other parts of the historic Catalan Lands: Valencia, the Balearic Islands, the eastern strip of Aragon, and the Roussillon area of southernmost France. 

The event was marked by solidarity displays from social sectors and institutions. Even the Barcelona Football Club announced that the strip of its B team would now be the yellow and red stripes of the official Catalan flag, and there were "Police for Independence", "Pensioners for Independence", and "Teachers for Independence".

The march continued for more than the intended two-and-a-half hours, and the mobile phone networks collapsed due to the sheer size of the demonstrations. The demonstration recorded the largest attendance in Catalan history, surpassing even the vast 2003 protests against the Iraq War and the million-plus 2010 protest against the ruling of the Spanish Constitutional Court that deemed sections of the 2006 Catalan Statute of Autonomy as unconstitutional.

The display of solidarity reinforced the message, with "independence" flags waving above the march while the predominant slogan chanted incessantly was "in-de-pen-den-cia". Other slogans in Spanish reflected the discontent of Catalan residents with "Spain, your robbery is genocide", "Your hatred is our goodbye", "Farewell, Spain", "Catalonia is not Spain" and "Yes we Cat!".

The overwhelming dominance of the independence flag floating above the march reinforced the message, although opinions remain divided on what sort of independence Catalans are campaigning for, with the blue-triangled estelada winning the battle of the flags and the yellow-and-red estelada designed by the Socialist Party of National Liberation (PSAN) coming in a clear second.

The huge protest was the culmination of the past three years of social aggression and violation against Catalan national rights that have convinced doubters that there is no other option but total independence. The Spanish Constitutional Court's support for important aspects of the Popular Party’s (PP) appeal against the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, the refusal of both PP and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) to agree to any serious reworking of the financing system for the autonomous communities, and the return of the PP to government nationally, increasing the war on Catalan culture and language have all contributed significantly to this sentiment.
