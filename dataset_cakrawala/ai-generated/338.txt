Being a new mom can be overwhelming, and the pressure to be the perfect parent can be suffocating. However, parenting is a learning experience, and no one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's essential to trust yourself and find what works best for you and your baby. Here are some tips that can help make parenting less stressful and more manageable. 

One of the most challenging tasks for a parent is to soothe a fussy baby. Some techniques might work, such as rubbing lavender essential oil or creating a cozy "cave" to calm your little one. Another tip is to mix medicine with chocolate syrup, use cold medicine to mask the taste or place a toy on your baby's belly to apply eyedrops.

As a new parent, it's also crucial to learn how to do everyday tasks with one hand, like text messaging, folding clothes, feeding pets, or even tending to your partner's personal needs. Another challenging task is hair washing, but it can be a fun experience by simulating a salon visit at home. All you have to do is lean your toddler back over the sink, give her a head massage, and use a towel to wrap her hair up like a turban. 

Trimming bangs can be tricky, but if you start from the outside edge of each eyebrow, it'll be virtually impossible to mess up. Flying can be stressful, but some airline attendants can provide you with a seat-belt extender or turn the buckle over to open on a different side, freeing your car-seat buckle. 

Finally, when your child is frustrated and crying in the car, play customized CDs that sing their name in every stanza, use white noise, or sing and dance with them to make the most of the situation. Being a parent is rewarding, and with patience and practice, these tips can help make it easier!
