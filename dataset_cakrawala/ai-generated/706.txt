Foreign ministers from 12 South American countries meeting in Caracas have promised to assist Venezuela with its ongoing food, medicine, and other product shortages. The regional Unasur bloc reached an agreement with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to supply items that have gone missing from many Venezuelan supermarkets. The scarcity of staples has exacerbated public discontent. Unasur emphasized the importance of preserving democratic stability. "The idea is to get all countries to support the distribution of staples," said Unasur Secretary-General Ernesto Samper (Union of South American Nations). "We will work with Venezuelan authorities to strengthen distribution networks in our countries so that they can help Venezuela," Mr Samper said. He condemned recent anti-government protests in Venezuela that turned violent. The opposition must "express its opinions in a democratic, peaceful, and lawful manner," according to Mr. Samper. 'Vote under threat' In the coming days, Unasur ministers will meet with opposition leaders and government officials to seek assurances that Venezuela will be able to hold free and fair elections later this year.

On Tuesday, opposition leader Henrique Capriles told the AFP news agency that Mr Maduro may cancel the election, which is scheduled for the second half of this year. "The government had never faced such a large deficit [in the polls] before an election. It now does. What difference does it make? It cheats the game "Mr Capriles stated. Mr. Maduro stated that the elections would take place as planned. Recently, he accused the opposition and the US of plotting a coup against his government. Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, was arrested last month and charged with conspiracy. Venezuela's business elite, according to Mr. Maduro, are boycotting his government. Last month, the owners of several supermarket and drugstore chains were arrested for allegedly fabricating long lines. They reduced the number of employees working at cash registers in order to "annoy the Venezuelan people," according to Mr Maduro. The oil-rich country's economic crisis has been exacerbated by falling oil prices on international markets. The opposition blames the crisis on the socialist policies of the previous 16 years.
