Winning War With A Specialized Approach

Draconia suggests that there are several upfront steps taken by leaders to ensure their clans win wars.

Firstly, the clan's top five players' average weight should be taken into consideration. An extra 10k to 20k is then added to that weight, ensuring that there are at least ten attacks that can 3-star at those numbers. This is done to ensure that the top of your wars will always be perfect.

Secondly, the clan's top defenders must be chosen carefully to ensure that they can repel attacks of the standard army levels that their account brings to war. The clan must have at least two good defenders on the top that can prevent the enemy from getting stars on every base. Anti-Hog, Anti-GOWIPE, and Anti-Air bases should also be on standby to switch up as needed depending on war match.

According to Draconia, every base in your clan should be defending against mirrors, unless they are defenseless. Everyone should have uniquely designed anti-lurable castles and hard bases for their level.

Draconia emphasized the importance of knowing the players' skill level in the clan, ensuring that every player has the capability of three-star attacks. The clan must have enough attacks by proven three-star players to cover all the new members. This ensures that the clan has enough attacks available to cover even five to ten mistakes by the trusted players.

Force all players in war to use a hybrid 0.5 upgrade plan, being weight conscious as they carefully pick and choose upgrades for their base that will most benefit their defense in war. According to Draconia, one defense upgrade per war is enough. Nobody should ever "max everything" at every level. Both will make your wars abnormally difficult to win.

A Range of Account Types for Winning Wars

Draconia suggests that account types should vary significantly to win wars. Employing a full range of accounts is crucial. A clan needs heavy defenders on top to prevent the enemy from landing a perfect. Hybrids with tremendous attacking power to clear the enemy's top bases with ease should also be present. A few minimax players to give the enemy's middle players a hard time is also handy. Defenseless/hybrid trap base is used to waste a few low-level player's attacks, and a few 100% pure defenseless accounts are needed at the bottom, preferably with TH6 or stronger attack power and skill to help give the clan an advantage on top.

Draconia says many high level war clans use ten to fifteen defenseless town hall 3s in every war to fill spots so that they can do larger wars. They issue a mismatch, which means that their top players are stronger so that they can win easily. Draconia prefers to use high attack power accounts with low TH4 or 5 weight.

Opinions About the Current Features and Functionality of the Game

Draconia has highly critical views on the game's current features and functionality, saying that Supercell is constantly making the game more challenging to progress and more complicated to understand. Draconia dislikes every other aspect of the game, such as farming, gathering resources, trophies, and has zero interest in that stuff. 

Draconia is highly aggravated by the poor development given to the game, saying the developers have simply ruled out plenty of great ideas that would improve gameplay for no reason. The developers' mentality is to play the game the way they want us to play it, or we will punish you! Draconia believes they are going out of their way to ruin defenseless accounts, to punish the minimax players who would keep low weight and get Infernos while matching up against TH7s, all the things they have done to punish engineered accounts. 

Conclusion

Clash of Clans is a game that requires a highly specialized approach to win wars. Draconia's views on the upfront steps to ensure that the clan wins the war and the range of account types employed to win wars must be carefully considered. Draconia also had highly critical views on the current features and functionality of the game. It is clear that there is a lot of thought and effort that goes on behind the scenes to achieve success in top-performing clans in Clash of Clans.
