It has become a regular occurrence for writers to express their opinions on the value of Master of Fine Arts (MFA) programs, sparking debates that seem to resurface every few months. One of the most recent examples is an essay by Eric Bennett in the Chronicle of Higher Education titled "How Iowa Flattened Literature." In it, Bennett critiques the fiction MFA system and, in particular, the Iowa Writersâ€™ Workshop for promoting uninspired, formulaic, and anti-intellectual literature. He claims that such programs stifle creativity and adhere too closely to predetermined writing mantras.

Both Bennett and Mark McGurl's critiques, however, focus primarily on the past, ignoring the significant reforms made by Lan Samantha Chang when she became director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 2006. Chang has increased demographic and aesthetic diversity in the program and secured full funding for every student. Her teaching style also differs greatly from her predecessors, fostering a more inclusive and conversational environment.

As a result, the works of Chang-era graduates, such as Eleanor Catton and Ayana Mathis, defy Bennett's claims of the program producing formulaic literature. The transformations brought about by Chang suggest that the MFA program is not inherently flawed, but that Bennett's criticisms may be specific to his own experiences in the class of 2000. Using the outdated teachings at Iowa as a marker for the current state of creative writing programs is misleading and overlooks the valuable contributions made by contemporary educators and students in the field.
