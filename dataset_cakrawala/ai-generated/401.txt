A recent event in Midland, Texas, has left residents of the neighbourhood shaken. The incident that occurred involved a 43-year-old man, Buddy Myers, who was arrested on suspicion of assault and brandishing a weapon after he reportedly opened fire at a teenage boy who was trying to retrieve his Frisbee Golf Frisbee that had landed in Myers' backyard.

It all began when the boy was playing Frisbee golf on a Tuesday evening when the Frisbee accidentally flew into Myers' yard. The boy decided to knock on Myers' door, asking for permission to retrieve his property. Unfortunately, there was no answer, and so, he peered over Myers' backyard fence. That's when Myers reportedly emerged from his home with a pistol and fired a shot towards the teenager.

When the police arrived at the scene at around 10 a.m., they found Myers barricaded in his home. The situation was tense, but they eventually managed to arrest him after a brief standoff. Myers was then charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, with a potential punishment of up to 20 years in jail.

According to city spokesperson Sara Higgins, the teenager had every legal right to retrieve his Frisbee from Myers' yard, since no trespass had occurred. She also noted that what the teenager and his friends did didn't warrant Myers' reaction.

"They weren't trying to go into the backyard to cause any harm," Higgins explained in an interview with KMID. "They were simply trying to retrieve their property. Again, we never advise that someone takes matters into their hands. But in this case, they did not do anything that warranted getting fired at."

Neighbours of Myers said that he had previously shown hostility towards Frisbee golfers who were regular visitors to the park behind his home. Nevertheless, nothing violent had occurred before this event. One of the neighbours, Steve Conley, was shocked by the extent of Myers' reaction.

"Not really surprised at Buddy," Conley admitted. "But we're surprised that he took a shot at a kid whose Frisbee accidentally went into his backyard. Thatâ€™s a little over the top."

The incident has left the community shaken, and many have expressed their concerns about what could have happened if Myers hadn't missed his target or if the boy was hurt. It has also apparent that Myers' reaction might discourage others from returning anything that might end up in their neighbour's yard, fearing similar responses.

In conclusion, the incident involving Buddy Myers has highlighted the importance of good neighbour relationships, where residents have an obligation to respect each other's property and take proactive approaches to resolve any conflict should they arise.
