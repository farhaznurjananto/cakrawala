South Sudan's journey to independence in 2011 marked a new beginning for this young nation. Subsequently, their entry into the world of international football in 2012 represents a symbol of hope and unity. Chabur Goc Alei, the president of South Sudan's Football Association, passionately believes that football has the power to bridge divides and bring lasting peace to this war-torn country. The recent widespread celebrations following South Sudan's first competitive victory against Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in a qualifier for the 2017 Nations Cup have clearly demonstrated the unifying force of sports.

According to Chabur, football transcends tribal and political affiliations, fostering a shared identity and sense of pride in South Sudan. By embracing this sport, the nation has the opportunity to overcome devastating conflicts that have torn families apart and displaced millions. As various tribes come together to work as a cohesive team on the soccer field, football promotes a peaceful and harmonious national spirit that is sorely needed in South Sudan.

Ever since South Sudan gained independence, its people have endured great suffering due to ongoing confrontations between rival political factions. Football, however, has the incredible potential to transcend these divisions - uniting people from different backgrounds and tribes under the banner of the national team. As one, the people rejoice in the team's successes and share the sorrow in their disappointments.

The monumental victory against Equatorial Guinea has not only placed South Sudan second in Group C but also ignited hope among its citizens. This hope is not solely focused on qualifying for the 2017 Nations Cup; it encompasses the overall betterment of the nation, spanning across the development of the sport, the players, and the society at large.

South Sudan is now poised to participate in the upcoming Nations Cup qualifiers against Benin in March. This competition provides the people of South Sudan with the perfect opportunity to come together as one, rallying behind their national team as it carries the dreams of a united, peaceful, and prosperous future. We believe in the power of football and that it will prove instrumental in fostering unity and harmony throughout South Sudan.
