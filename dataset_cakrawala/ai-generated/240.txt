Are you a car enthusiast that thinks outside of the box when it comes to your project cars? If so, you may want to take a page out of Jordan's book. When Jordan stumbled upon a beat-up $250 BMW E30 shell on Craigslist, he saw an opportunity to get creative. Instead of opting for a running car, or even a car with an intact drivetrain, Jordan went for the rusted frame of a 318i that was intended to be turned into a race car, but had been abandoned by its previous owner.

Jordan embarked on a journey of trial and error, filled with arduous tasks, long hours, and determination to bring his vision to life. After reading the car's documents, which revealed that it was bought at a dealership in Frankfurt, Germany, and that it had only received its first registration in the US in 1996, Jordan was inspired to name his project "Project Lessmeister." He got to work cleaning the chassis, installing new body panels, and sending them off to the paint shop.

All the while, Jordan was at home rebuilding the car's sub-assemblies with brand new and reconditioned OEM BMW parts. Once the car was painted in a vibrant shade of red, Jordan's next task was installing an M54 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine coupled with a six-speed transmission from an E46. He also used the E46 steering rack and countless other upgraded components that, through custom fabrication and hard work, all fit perfectly.

It took Jordan five and a half months to complete most of the work in his free evenings and weekends while maintaining his 50-hour a week job. He admitted that the cost was substantial, likely in the five-figure range, but the feeling of accomplishment was incomparable to anything that came with a warranty.

Even though the car is not yet entirely complete, Jordan's BMW E30 is, in our honest opinion, a testimonial to what one person can do with some cash, time, tools, and a strong will to complete a project. By looking at the final product, it's easy to see why so many car enthusiasts embark on such projects themselves.
