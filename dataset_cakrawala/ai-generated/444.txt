Yellowstone National Park is one of America's most popular tourist destinations, but the potential dangers of hiking in one of the country's wildest and most remote landscapes are always a concern. That concern became painfully real back on August 7th, 2015 when a Montana hiker was found dead in the vicinity of the Elephant Back Loop Trail in the Lake Village area of the park.

The dying of the hiker triggered an investigation to determine how he died. A park ranger found the body in the middle of the day after the hiker had been reported as missing earlier that morning by his co-workers, who knew he was planning on hiking in the area. Until his next of kin was notified, the hiker's identity was kept confidential.

Many of the signs have seemed to point towards the involvement of a grizzly bear in the hiker's death, particularly since there were clear signs of bear activity in the area. Although experts have yet to come to a conclusive ruling in the case, they suggest that the hiker may have died sometime between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. As of now, the Elephant Back Loop Trail is closed for investigation until the cause of the hiker's death has been definitively determined.

Authorities have stressed the importance of people being careful while hiking in Yellowstone, particularly in areas known to be frequented by bears. To decrease the likelihood of a dangerous encounter, hikers are advised to follow several guidelines, including staying on designated trails, letting someone know your plans, hiking in groups of three or more, making noise while hiking, and possessing bear spray for protection.

This event highlights the need for caution when visiting Yellowstone National Park, but it also serves to emphasize the importance of the work being done by the National Park Service. With more than twenty-thousand employees who help oversee the care of over four hundred national parks across the country, the park system provides countless opportunities for Americans to explore and appreciate the natural world around them.
