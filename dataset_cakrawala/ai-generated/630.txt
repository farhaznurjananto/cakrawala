The Best Buy Canada website accidentally revealed a new, smaller version of the popular Nintendo Wii console called "Nintendo Wii Mini." This leak suggests that Nintendo has taken a similar approach as Microsoft with their Xbox 360 and Sony with their PS3, releasing a more compact version of their successful console.

According to the leaked information on the Best Buy Canada homepage, the launch date for the Nintendo Wii Mini is set to be December 7th, 2012. Up until now, Nintendo has successfully kept the development of the Wii Mini under wraps. The Wii Mini displayed on the website appears to be much smaller than the original console.

If you want to check out the Wii Mini image, head to the Best Buy Canada homepage before the error is likely to be fixed. Interestingly, the Wii Mini is not listed in the product page with other Wii hardware. Its size can be compared to that of an external optical drive for computers.

The leak also showcases a 'pre-order now' button alongside the December 7th release date. However, when clicked, it only directs users to the general Nintendo Wii category without any sign of the Wii Mini. This indicates that the advertisement may have been posted ahead of schedule.
