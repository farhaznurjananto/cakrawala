The arrest reports also explain what led police to believe that the two men were attempting to carry out the attack. A tipster, who is not named in the documents, told the FBI that a friend of his had gone to Syria to fight with the Islamic State. That friend then told the tipster that Choudhary had been in contact with him, allegedly discussing an attack in the U.S.

The tipster also told the FBI that Choudhary had allegedly posted propaganda videos, photos and other terror-related content on social media.

The FBI said they were able to track Choudharyâ€™s movements to a Chicago suburb and eventually to the garage where he was arrested. The second man, Farooque, was arrested in his home.

The two men now face charges of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State, which are punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

The arrests came just weeks after a couple in New York were arrested on terrorism-related charges after they allegedly tried to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

The arrests are just the latest in a series of high-profile terrorism cases in the U.S. in recent months. In March, two men were arrested after they were found with an explosive device in their car in Minnesota. In December, a man was arrested after he allegedly planned to detonate a bomb in a busy shopping district in Manhattan. And in July, a woman was arrested after she tried to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

The arrests in Chicago come as the FBI ramps up its efforts to track down potential terrorists. The agency said last month that it had conducted more than 900 terrorism investigations since September 11, 2001. Of those investigations, the FBI said 50 percent have led to charges being filed.
