There has been a considerable amount of confusion regarding how Israel's ruling party, Likud, came to support an individual like Glenn Beck. However, the reality is that they are well-suited for each other, and while Beck may be the one speaking out in a bizarre manner, it is Likud that is taking action on their shared beliefs.

In retrospect, Haaretz wonders about Glenn Beck's visit, expressing bewilderment at how individuals from Israel's ruling party, particularly Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Ya'alon and World Likud Chairman Danny Danon, became part of Beck's fanbase. However, this perspective seems to overlook the fact that Glenn Beck and Likud share common goals and actively collaborate with one another.

Beck's connection with Israel did not happen spontaneously; he was invited to speak at the Knesset by Likud MK Danny Danon in July. His scheduler for his later August visit, Jonny Daniels, was also an advisor to Danon. Furthermore, Danon played a significant role in organizing the Restoring Courage rallies, and multiple Israeli politicians met with Beck during his August visit.

Likud's goals are clear, and they have made no effort to hide their intentions. Despite former Israeli defense officials claiming the 1967 borders are defensible, Prime Minister and Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly stated that Israel will not return to those boundaries. He has also discussed Israel's intentions to annex the Jordan Valley in the West Bank and has been building a case for an attack on Iran.

Although Likud is open about their objectives, they aim to maintain a semblance of respectability and legitimacy while leaving the more dramatic rhetoric to Beck, who is often dismissed by the Israeli media as a madman. Ultimately, Beck and Likud desire the same outcome: unchecked Israeli expansion and regional control. This alliance makes sense given their shared priorities, but the strangest aspect is the Israeli public's continued support for a party that enacts policies that appear more damaging than Beck's speeches.

If Beck is considered insane simply for his vocalizations, it's worth considering the sanity of those who implement the expansionist policies that he and Likud support. Both Beck and Likud are part of the same problem, and it's time for the Israeli media and public to take a hard look at their own ruling party as well.
