The latest release of Windows 10, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, is set to launch on October 17th. With its launch, Microsoft will be introducing a number of new features and changes to the operating system. However, not all changes are appreciated equally. In this article, we will highlight some of the things that may be concerning to certain users of Windows 10.

One of the main changes in the Fall Creators Update is the introduction of the "Fluent Design System." This new design language is meant to be implemented over several releases, but the initial implementation in the upcoming release is inconsistent. The update will have three design languages--legacy, Modern Design Language 2, and Fluent Design--which can be confusing for those who notice design choices. The Fluent Design "reveal" effect, for example, is being implemented sporadically throughout the Windows Shell, which can be frustrating. While this may have been intentional, to ease users into the new design, it can be jarring to notice these inconsistencies.

Another issue that arises in the Fall Creators Update is the lack of developer support for My People, a new feature that aims to bring all your contacts on different services together. While this feature is promising, the user interface appears unfinished, and there has been little developer support. This lack of support may persist, as only a couple of third-party apps have been updated to support My People. Furthermore, without the aid of larger apps like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp taking advantage of this feature, it may fail to gain traction with users.

Lastly, certain options that were once available in past Windows 10 updates are now missing from the Fall Creators Update. While the reason for the removal of these options may vary, changes like these can be frustrating for users who have become used to certain features.

While the Fall Creators Update may not be perfect for everyone, it's important to remember that Microsoft has implemented changes to help ease users into the new design language and feature set. As is the case with all Windows 10 updates, it may take time for users and developers to adjust to the changes and take advantage of the new features.
