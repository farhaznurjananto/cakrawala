Toontown's Twelve Days of Winter:

The Great Snowball Fight, Christmas History, and More!

The holiday season is in full swing in Toontown, and the Toon Council has been hard at work making sure that there are plenty of festivities to go around. From cheerful costumes to white winter wonderlands, there's something for everyone.

On the twelfth day of winter, the Toon Council is giving Toons one final gift: the BIGGEST Snowball Fight the town has ever seen! This tradition was started by Slappy Quackintosh many years ago, and continues to bring Toons together every year.

Although Slappy has been missing for some time now, the Toon Council remains committed to finding him and bringing him back to his rightful place as President. They have been chasing down leads and believe that he may be held captive by the dreaded Cogs and their corporate empire.

In the meantime, Toontown's Twelve Days of Winter has been a resounding success, with caroling Snowtoons, brand new winter music, and festive decorations that have brought joy to Toons of all ages. And let's not forget about the Mega Cog Invasion that took the town by storm!

If you missed any of the festivities up until this point, don't worry. You still have until December 30th at 11:59 PM Toontown Time (PST) to enjoy all of the gifts that have been given over the past twelve days.

As President of the Toon Council, Flippy wishes all Toons a happy and safe holiday season. And in the spirit of Slappy, let the Great Toontown Snowball Fight commence!
