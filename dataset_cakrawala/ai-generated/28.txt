The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced on Wednesday that the agency has issued a quarantine order for a shipment of live reindeer from Norway.

APHIS said the shipment, which was headed for a facility in Kansas, is suspected of being infected with a virus that can cause abortion in reindeer. Reindeer are the primary animal used in traditional Norwegian Christmas celebrations.

The agency said that the shipment has been turned over to the FBI for further investigation.

"We are taking this step as a precaution to protect public health and the environment," said APHIS Director Dr. Phil Smith. "We will continue to work with our federal and state partners to monitor this situation and take any necessary steps to protect the public."

The virus that is suspected of causing abortion in reindeer is known as the T4 virus. It has been found in other wild animals, such as deer, but has not been found in domestic animals in the United States.

This is the first time that APHIS has issued a quarantine order for a shipment of live reindeer. The agency is working with the FBI and other partners to ensure that the public is protected.

There is no evidence that the public is at risk from this shipment. APHIS is monitoring the situation closely and will take any necessary steps to protect the public.
