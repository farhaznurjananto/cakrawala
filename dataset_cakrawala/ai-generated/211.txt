Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on Wednesday night on the sidelines of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summits. Modi expressed his strong commitment to take bilateral ties to new heights not only with China but with Russia as well, whom he considers an old friend. However, he also voiced his concerns over China's continuous blockage of UN actions on Pakistan (whom India considers responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks) and the proposed Pakistan-China economic corridor which crosses India’s territorial borders.

The meeting between Modi and Jinping was the fourth bilateral meeting between the two leaders since their first in Brazil in July 2014. During the meeting, Modi conveyed his objections to Jinping over the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that runs through occupied Kashmir, which India considers as part of its own territory.

Post the meeting, Modi expressed his appreciation for Jinping and wrote on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, that the meeting was comprehensive and included discussions on global affairs, as well as India-China bilateral ties. Both leaders are strongly committed to taking these ties to new heights and increasing their economic, cultural, and people-to-people relationships.

Modi also called for continued cooperation among BRICS members to strengthen the global economy. In his address to the BRICS Business Council, he voiced his concern over the lack of global economic growth and the instability of financial markets. He made a veiled attack on the US and some European countries which have imposed sanctions on Russia over its alleged role in the Ukraine crisis, stating that unilateral sanctions were hurting the global economy. 

Modi stressed the similarities and resources of the BRICS nations like agriculture, manufacturing, technology, human resources, and sustainable development which together represent 44% of the world’s population and contribute to 40% of the global GDP. Finally, he called for deeper and stronger cooperation among its members and working with other developed regions to boost the global economy.
