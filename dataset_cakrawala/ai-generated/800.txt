Oracle Card Title: Wake Thrasher Mana Investment in Mana Units Cost: 3 Types: Creature Military Member of the Merpeople Wake Thrasher gains +1/+1 until the end of the round for each untapped permanent you control. Whoever said merrows are all brains and no strength has obviously never been ran over by one. P/T: 1 / 1 The Eventide Expansion Distinctiveness: Very Uncommon Ready to Go: Ticket No. 31 Jesper Ejsing, the artist. Rulings Wake Thresher's ability will activate that many times, depending on how many permanents you control go untapped during your untap step. They won't be activated until your upkeep phase, though, because no player has priority during the untap step. All your "start of upkeep" conditions will be met at that moment. You can put them and Wake Thresher's abilities on the stack in any order.
