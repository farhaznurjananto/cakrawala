Title: Gustavo Dantas Discusses His Jiu-Jitsu Journey and Building Champions on and off the Mat

Gustavo Dantas, Nova União USA’s head coach and promoter of Jiu-Jitsu tournaments, is eagerly gearing up for the first-ever World Master and Senior Jiu-Jitsu Championship, taking place in Long Beach, California, on October 7th. Fresh off a gold medal win at the US Nationals, Gustavo discussed his competition plans, newly-established school, and his philosophy on building champions on and off the mat in an interview with GRACIEMAG.

When asked about his team's performance at the Nationals, Gustavo expressed happiness with their 17 medals from 23 competitors. Even though the team was smaller due to other commitments, their performance was strong. Gustavo, who is known for his busy schedule, shared his insights on balancing competition preparation with other responsibilities. He trains twice a day, five days a week, focusing on both Jiu-Jitsu and strength conditioning. Gustavo believes confidence comes from hard work, and he does not compete without proper preparation.

Gustavo's new Jiu-Jitsu Academy celebrated its six-month anniversary and already has 200 students, including over 40 children. He is proud of fulfilling his teenage dream of owning a fully dedicated Jiu-Jitsu academy while still competing and coaching at nearly 38 years old. Gustavo's teaching philosophy changed over time; while he initially aimed to build champions on the mat, he now wants students to succeed both in the sport and in life. A big proponent of self-improvement and mental coaching, his ultimate goal is to carry on this legacy, teaching his students to persevere, achieve their dreams, and pass along the knowledge to others while continuing their own journeys.

Lastly, Gustavo extends his thanks to his sponsors and training partners, expressing his dedication to coaching and helping his students achieve their goals.
