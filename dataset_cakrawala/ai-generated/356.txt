Former Strikeforce champion and Invicta FC featherweight champion Cristiane “Cyborg” Justino can finally breathe a sigh of relief after getting cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of the Spironolactone doping allegations. The Brazilian knockout artist was under a two-month investigation after being flagged late last year for using the physician-prescribed diuretic, which is known to mask the use of steroids. Cyborg was given a retroactive therapeutic use exemption (TUE) which cleared her of any wrongdoing just two days after the inaugural women’s featherweight title bout between Holly Holm and Germaine de Randamie at UFC 208.

Cyborg recently spoke with Ariel Helwani on The MMA Hour, explaining how her name was wrongly tarnished by media and other influencers like UFC commentator Joe Rogan, who presumed her guilty before the actual results came out, and put the blame on her via Twitter, which led to even more confusion and stress for Cyborg. The Brazilian fighter expressed her gratitude for her team, her lawyer, and to Jeff Novitzy, who works for UFC, for helping her throughout the process. The tension escalated for the Brazilian when the situation negatively affected her career and personal life, including losing sponsors and public appearances during the investigation. 

Despite the challenges, Cyborg remains focused on realizing her dream of becoming a UFC champion, a feat she plans to achieve even if she has to take on another challenge before gunning for Germaine de Randamie’s title. Her determination has been driven by the lessons she learned from the doping allegations, which involved making mistakes, accepting responsibility, learning from them, and focusing on the people who support her as she moves forward. 

Now that Cyborg’s good name has been cleared, she’ll be free to return to the Octagon whenever she wants, and besides being the front-runner to test the Dutch champion’s first ever women’s 145-pound champ Germaine de Randamie, Cyborg’s next move is to sustain the momentum generated from her clearance and remain focused on her dreams until the day she achieves them.
