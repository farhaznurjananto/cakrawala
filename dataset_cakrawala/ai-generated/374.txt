When you agree with two opposing individuals, the world begins to feel confusing. This feeling occurs for some individuals with regards to economics because of the debates between Dinesh D’Souza and Paul Krugman. Now, both of them are partly right, but neither of them hits the specific discussion that needs to be made that revolves around capitalism’s present form.

Warren Buffet explained succinctly how his “class, the rich class” is effectively waging war through class warfare. What this means is that the American system benefits the wealthy, with countless market interventions exclusively aimed at assisting corporations and individuals who remain unaffected by the plight that working-class people face. 

Those who advocate for shielding economic titans for criticism are misguided because these individuals often receive unjust assistance from the American government’s anti-market policies. From intellectual property protection to licensing requirements, zoning mandates, and taxes, the economic opportunities for working people are frequently marginalized. This inequality is not just limited to the wealthy, as even average businesspeople who cannot leverage special government favors are treated much more gently than those taking advantage of government protections.

Although Dinesh D’Souza argues that “the anti-colonialist believes that since the rich have prospered at the expense of others, their wealth doesn’t really belong to them; therefore whatever can be extracted from them is automatically just,” he is ignoring the fact that this argument isn't solely about legitimate productivity. Rather, it is about unjustly winning elite status through government protection.

In truth, our biggest problem lies in the debate itself because we have been tricked into thinking that our only options as Americans are to either expand the power of the organization that caused the issue or retain a corporatist economy without any safety net for the poor. This binary is unsavory because those who utilize state power to bolster their bank accounts aren't friends of freedom or markets.

Fake free markets or morally corrupt state power are the only two credible political avenues available in mainstream American discourse, which means that any meaningful, free-market debate is stuck between two political sides who are more interested in self-serving, rather than resolving the issue at hand.
