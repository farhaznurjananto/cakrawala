Under a cloud of secrecy, Dublin City Council's water works officials convened with Risk Management International (RMI), a surveillance firm run by former soldiers. The pressing concern on the agenda? To explore strategies for monitoring the tireless protesters rallying against water charges. Unsurprisingly, this shrouded meeting has incited vehement opposition from the vocal protesters.

The council discovered itself in need of RMI's surveillance mastery due to a concerning surge in reports of council employees falling prey to "bullying and harassment" connected to the passionate water charge protests. Having previously dipped its toes in the murky waters of Irish Water surveillance, RMI eagerly pitched its services to the local authority, invoking "health and safety" measures as justification for their proposal. The council, despite initial interest, decided to forego RMI's offering.

Water charge protesters, upon hearing of the secretive meeting, raised their flags of injustice, arguing that it constituted unwarranted targeting by State institutions. A spokesperson for Dublin City Council confirmed that the meeting took place, emphasizing the troubling increase in harassment cases sparked by anti-meter installation protests. 

People before Profit councilor John Lyons expressed unease at RMI's first known direct engagement with a State organization, calling the occurrence "disturbing". Amidst this brewing controversy, the Right2Water campaign opened its doors for a national conference, extending an invitation to prospective general election candidates to unite beneath the umbrella group.
