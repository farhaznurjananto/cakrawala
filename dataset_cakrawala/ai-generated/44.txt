Appearing on the Today Show earlier in the day, Speaker Ryan, who has repeatedly said he would be willing to drop the Trump-related investigation if the president agreed to work with him on a legislative agenda, said he was willing to work with the president on a tax reform package.

“We have a shared vision on tax reform,” he said.

“I think we have a shared vision on health care,” he added.

“We have the same vision on national security, so we’ve just got to get to work,” he concluded.

During a meeting with the president and congressional Republicans on Tuesday, Ryan said the president was “excited about getting to work with the Senate and the House on passing an agenda that raises wages, that lowers the cost of living, and that restores the American Idea.”
