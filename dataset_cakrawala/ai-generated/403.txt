The Evolution of Business Correspondence: From Penny Post to Comprehensive Manuals

The way we communicate in business has changed drastically over time. In the early days, communication was often limited to those who were wealthy, artistic or connected to each other. However, with the advent of the industrial revolution and rising literacy rates, the number of correspondents increased significantly and so did the need for more accessible and understandable communication. This led to the democratization of letters, which underwent a dramatic change over time.

William Dockraw, a London merchant, was the first to recognize this need and addressed it with his invention of the Penny Post in 1680. The postal service charged by the sheet and the distance traveled, which was further charged to the recipient, making it a costly business expense. Dockraw's innovation allowed letters to be sent within the greater London area for a penny, and was a breakthrough that allowed the postal system to reach a wider audience.

The early English novelists, such as Samuel Richardson, were inspired by this character-based approach and ecumenical view of “business” communication. Richardson's first novel 'Pamela, Or Virtue Rewarded' focused on a young maidservant's correspondence with her parents as she tries to fend off the dishonorable advances of her employer. The novel became a natural extension of learning how to write polite letters, a pursuit for which only the wealthy had access to in the past.

Chesterfield’s obsession with clarity had a lot to do with the fact that a letter-writer who was addressing a correspondent might not know much about his/her potential audience. Rising literacy rates and reformation of the mail service produced more correspondents, and the need for a comprehensive manual on business correspondence was recognized. This led to the development of various manuals, such as 'The Young Secretary’s Guide to Polite Epistolary Correspondence' (1778) and 'The Complete Art of Writing Letters' (1779), which contained over 500 sample letters specially designed for people of different classes and states of life.

Adam Smith, who taught rhetoric and belles lettres, embraced the idea that writing should be tailored to cater to the sloppiest, least energetic audience, in accordance with his beliefs about the low abilities and imperfect education of potential readers. The need for clear and concise correspondence remains important today, as businesses continue to rely on written communication for many aspects of their operations.

In conclusion, the evolution of business correspondence from Penny Post to comprehensive manuals reflects the changing times in which we continue to evolve. From the early days, when letter-writing was limited to the wealthy and connected, to the present day where business communication is more democratic, it is clear that innovation has played an important role in making written communication more accessible, comprehensive, and inclusive to everyone.
