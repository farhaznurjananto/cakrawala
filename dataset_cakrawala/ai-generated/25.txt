rawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 1.54 KB Error code: 0x80070003 Error description: The system cannot find the path specified. Software: Windows 8 Pro 64 bits English (United States) Hardware: Dell XPS 17 (L702X) I did this once before to get the Windows 8 developer preview to work on my Dell XPS 17, and it worked flawlessly. But when I tried to use this method to get the Consumer Preview to work, I got the above error. I did all the steps, and I even checked to make sure that the file in question existed in the place where I was told to look, but I still got the error. I tried it again, and I even tried a different location, but still no luck. What am I doing wrong? I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64 bits. I have a Dell XPS 17, and it has an Intel Core i7-2630QM CPU @ 2.00 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, the NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M graphics card, the Intel Thunderbolt Controller, the Intel Smart Connect Technology Device, and the Intel Smart Connect Technology System Application. I want to try the Windows 8 Consumer Preview on my Dell XPS 17, but I keep getting the error code 0x80070003.
