Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has announced that he has given up alcohol after experiencing a "come to Jesus moment." This follows as the city council stripped him of most of his powers. The 44-year-old mayor told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he was done with drinking. Earlier, Mr. Ford had declared "outright war" on city council members who had just voted to further limit his authority. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has described the allegations against Mr. Ford as "troubling."

The mayor of Canada's largest city has faced increasing pressure to resign since admitting to smoking crack cocaine while in a "drunken stupor" earlier this month. Furthermore, Mr. Ford faces claims of making lewd propositions to a female staff member, using racially abusive language, threatening staff, and consorting with an alleged prostitute.

During a CBC interview on Monday night, Mr. Ford stated that he had not consumed alcohol for three weeks and planned never to do so again. "I've had a come-to-Jesus moment, if you want to call it that," he said. "Just the humiliation and the belittling and the people I've let down. And it's all because of alcohol. Excessive, stupid, immature behavior and that's it." However, the mayor did admit to purchasing marijuana since taking office but denied ever driving while under the influence.

Despite the ongoing scandal, the mayor shows no signs of avoiding the public eye. Mr. Ford and his older brother Doug Ford, a city council member, launched their own current events television program on Monday evening. However, the television network decided to cancel the hour-long program called Ford Nation after airing just one episode.

Earlier this week, the council approved a special motion that reduced Mr. Ford's office budget by 60%, decreased his staff from 19 to approximately eight, and transferred many of his powers to the deputy mayor. This comes after the council voted last week to prevent him from being able to dismiss the deputy mayor and remove his emergency powers. The council members do not have the authority to remove Mr. Ford from office unless he has a criminal conviction. He has insisted that he will run for re-election in October 2014.
