Title: The Origins and Effects of Black Urban Ghettos

Introduction:
Black urban ghettos have been a major issue in the United States for a long time. The first part of this article delved into why these ghettos have become poorer and more isolated than ever before. The second part examines how to turn the situation around as this culture sustains itself.

I. Free Fall
Chicago's 47th St. and South Parkway is known for its diverse community. Here, there is a continuous movement of people, all with different skin colors. In nearby drug stores and most other stores, customers encounter colored clerks. In offices, doctors, dentists and lawyers of color carry out their duties while brown-skinned policemen walk along swinging their clubs, and glaring at the mischievous urchins.

II. Concentrated Powerful Poverty
African Americans in urban areas of concentrated poverty face poor living conditions- violent crime, poor education, drug addiction, as well as high unemployment rates. As a result, ghetto residents remain poor due to a lack of resources. Inner city businesses suffer from paying high insurance and security costs. Consequently, poverty breeds poverty as opposed to job creation, opportunity, and overall economic growth.

III. The Self-Sustaining System
The effects of the ghettos are self-sustaining with many factors contributing to the phenomenon of ghettoization. A bleak outlook on life, limited education and job opportunities, the vast concentration of poverty, and the lack of resources to support successful life lead to greater isolation within these communities.

IV. Turning the Situation Around
It is vital to reverse these negative effects and end the cycle of urban poverty. New policies can be implemented by the government such as improving schools and funding programs that invest in business or subsidizing rents to create affordable housing. Real change, however, will occur when individuals empower their voices to demand necessary changes by using voting as a tool to elect officials committed to making a difference.

Conclusion:
African Americans, particularly those in urban areas, face poverty of immense concentration, leading to the isolation of the communities at large. New policies and grassroot efforts can reverse these negative effects, begin the dismantling the current self-sustaining culture, and promote revitalization in these communities.
