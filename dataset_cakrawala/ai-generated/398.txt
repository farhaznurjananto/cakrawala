Lord Hague said he would be "more likely" to vote leave if there was another referendum on Brexit, adding: "You can't go around in circles. We have to stick to the decision."

Lord Hague, a former Foreign Secretary, has warned against holding a second referendum on the UK's exit from the European Union, saying it would be the most "divisive" moment in British politics for over a hundred years.

The former Conservative leader argued that the UK's negotiations with the EU have been "fairly predictable" so far, and it is up to both sides to secure a breakthrough.

Lord Hague also suggested that a "no-deal" scenario would not be a good outcome for the country.

Despite calls from the Liberal Democrats for a "final say" on the withdrawal agreement, Lord Hague warned against revisiting the issue, saying it would be a "hate-filled" campaign if the government attempted to tell people "they were wrong" when voting to leave in 2016.

He went on to say that he would be "more likely" to vote leave if there was another poll, adding: "You can't go around in circles. We have to stick to the decision."

The former foreign secretary noted that more people had voted to leave the EU in June 2016 than had voted for any government in British history.

"It would be the most divisive event in this country since the arguments over Irish home rule at least, to try and go back over this issue," he said. "Imagine the hate-filled campaign that would divide this country. I do not think that is a price worth paying."
